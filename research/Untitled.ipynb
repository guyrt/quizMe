Its \\npriority is to enhance the digital experience of customers and improve the \\nefficiency, intuitiveness, and user-friendliness of online services. This initiative \\naligns with SNB's vision of Excellence in Service Delivery and its commitment \\nto customer-centric service design and delivery. \\n\\n6.2  SERVICES REQUIRED BY SERVICE NEW BRUNSWICK  \\n\\nSNB is seeking a partner for a 3-month engagement to introduce and train \\nSNB/GNB teams in a framework to enable the delivery of high-quality, easy to \\nuse, digital services.  The budget for this engagement is $300,000. \\n\\nThe overall approach should ensure the customer is at the center of every \\ndecision that impacts them as services must be co-designed with customers in \\nboth official languages.  This approach should allow for feedback about the \\nservice to be captured and actioned upon with quick turnaround times. \\n\\nDue to the unknown time frame by including customers in the process, upon \\nagreement of both parties, an extension of sixty (60) days may be considered for \\nphase one (1). \\n\\nAfter delivering the approach, the vendor will work with SNB/GNB teams to \\nmodernize and launch a service as described below in the deliverables section. \\nThis work will be used to test and refine the approach.  \\n\\nDeliverables for phase 1: \\n\\n1.  A documented framework that includes: \\n\\n•  A process to deliver high-quality, easy to use, digital services which \\n\\nare customer focused and in alignment with the GNB Design System. \\n\\n 13 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0c•  A consistent approach to co-designing with the customer.  Co-\\n\\ndesigning with the customer is mandatory and must be performed in \\nboth official languages, this means the customer will be actively \\nengaged throughout the entire process, including understanding \\ncustomer needs, through the design process as well as user testing to \\nensure all solutions meet the needs of customers. We are expecting \\nthe vendor to provide the approach as part of the framework to engage \\nwith customers. \\n\\n•  A consistent approach to gather regular feedback and implement \\n\\nimprovements based on the feedback. \\n\\n•  A consistent approach to engage client departments in the \\n\\ndevelopment of an end-to-end digital service. \\n\\n•  A consistent approach to ensure solutions are fully responsive and \\naccessible across all modern devices and platforms. The solutions \\nmust also be scalable, allowing for the ability to scale horizontally or \\nvertically as needed. \\n\\n2.  An online service implemented in both official languages using this \\n\\nframework. SNB has identified a notification service for vehicle registration \\nrenewals which is an ideal candidate for this engagement.  The current \\nservice exists in two parts: \\n\\n•  Opt Out of Paper Registration Renewal Reminders \\n\\n(https://www.pxw1.snb.ca/snb9000/product.aspx?productid=A001P\\n780901&l=e) \\n\\n•  Your Vehicle Renewal Reminder \\n\\n(https://www.pxw1.snb.ca/snb9000/product.aspx?ProductID=A001\\nPSN780900&l=e)  \\n\\nBy the end of the engagement, it is expected the vendor will have \\ncompleted the production deployment of a single service in both official \\nlanguages which manages renewal reminders on SNB.ca and satisfies the \\nneeds of the customer. \\n\\nSNB expects the selected partner to deliver the client experience modernization \\nand enhancements within the defined 3-month engagement period. The solution \\nmust align with the GNB Design System and comply with SNB's standards for \\nlanguage, security, privacy, and accessibility. \\n\\nThe contract for this engagement will include an optional phase two (2) based on \\navailable funding.  At the discretion of SNB, and upon mutual agreement of both \\nparties, Phase 2 will be an option for a 9-to-12-month extension to deliver up to \\n\\n 14 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0c10 new digital services.  Phase 2 will be decided based on the success and \\nlearnings from phase 1. The budget for the optional extension will be defined and \\nagreed upon during the project. \\n\\n 15 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0c7.0 \\n\\nPROPOSAL CONTENT & REQUIREMENTS \\n\\nProposals must include a table of contents, be presented in the following format, \\nand include a response to each question in the order in which it is asked. It is \\nhelpful to the evaluation committee if the corresponding section headings are \\nutilized in your submission.  \\n\\n7.1  MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS \\n\\nThe following mandatory requirements must be addressed by all vendors \\nin their proposals: \\n\\nPlease note that failure to address any of the below mandatory requirements in \\nthe proposal will result in the disqualification of the vendor from further \\nevaluation.  \\n\\nSubmissions must be received in their entirety by the time and date indicated. \\n\\nSubmissions must be signed by an official of the company who is authorized to \\nsign on behalf of/and bind the company to statements made in their submission. \\n\\nThe “Grand Total” proposed by the vendor for the duration of the three-month \\nterm, exclusive of any extensions, must not exceed $300,000 in Canadian funds, \\nexclusive of taxes. Pricing submissions more than $300,000, exclusive of taxes, \\nwill result in immediate disqualification of the proposal.  \\n\\nSubmissions must include the following appendices/documents: \\n•  Appendix A - Project Team Chart, and \\n•  Appendix B – Reference Form. \\n\\n7.2  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS \\n\\n7.2.1  COMPANY BACKGROUND WITH REFERENCES \\n\\nProvide a brief summary of the history of your company including years in \\nbusiness, number of staff, location, etc. \\n\\nProvide references of clients for whom you have completed a project of \\nsimilar scope and nature as this project.
