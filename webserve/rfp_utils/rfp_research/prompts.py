- Board certifications like Medical licenses, Legal license (passed bar), or CPA. Only include if you can find a specific license requirement.
- Legal jurisdictions that apply to the contract.

ONLY include prerequisites if they are specific.

Here are some example requirements:
"Demonstration of team members' experience in an Agile framework such as SAFe, Scrum, Kanban, or Lean" -- this mentions specific frameworks.
"ISO-6467 required"  -- this mentions an ISO certification.
"SOC-2 compliance required" -- this is a specific compliance requirement.
                      
Here are some examples that you should NEVER return:
"Submission of pricing information following the guidelines provided" -- this is a requirement for the submission document, not for the contracted work. 
"Description of how changes to this project will be managed" -- this is a requirement for the submission document.
"A copy of each team memberâ€™s resume" -- this is a requirement about the submission document.
"Pricing must cover all aspects of the project, including delivery, installation, start-up, and any required equipment or software licenses"
"Each proposal must be submitted in Microsoft Word or Excel, or PDF" -- this is about the submission document.
Only return requirements from the actual document!
