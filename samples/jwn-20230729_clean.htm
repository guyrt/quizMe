Item 1A. Risk Factors.
As of the date of this report, we do not believe any other currently identified claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Since these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties, our view of them may change in the future.
On March 2, 2023, Nordstrom Canada commenced a wind-down of its business operations. Nordstrom Canada entities obtained an Initial Order from the Ontario Superior Court of Justice under the CCAA to facilitate the wind-down in an orderly fashion. See Note 2: Canada Wind-down in Part I for more information.
We are subject from time to time to various claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business, including lawsuits alleging violations of state and/or federal wage and hour and other employment laws, privacy and other consumer-based claims. Some of these lawsuits may include certified classes of litigants, or purport or may be determined to be class or collective actions and seek substantial damages or injunctive relief, or both, and some may remain unresolved for several years. We believe the recorded accruals in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are adequate in light of the probable and estimable liabilities.

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Disclosure controls and procedures are defined by Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified within the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we have performed an evaluation of the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the last day of the period covered by this report.
On May 29, 2023, Cathy R. Smith was appointed Chief Financial Officer, and the Company’s principal financial officer and principal accounting officer. In the second quarter of 2023, Michael W. Maher, who was an officer, employee and had been serving as the Company’s interim principal financial officer for the purposes of the Exchange Act since the third quarter of 2022, departed the Company. We do not believe that Mr. Maher’s resignation has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Our Chief Executive Officer, Erik B. Nordstrom, serves as our principal executive officer for the purposes of the Exchange Act.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
Our estimates are dependent on the outcome of the Nordstrom Canada wind-down process, including the amount of third-party and Nordstrom claims asserted and recognized in the claims process, the amount of assets available for distribution, the negotiation of a CCAA plan of arrangement approved by the creditors and the Ontario Superior Court of Justice and the outcome of negotiations regarding the leases. We continue to work through the wind-down process and our estimates of losses are based on currently available information and our assessment of the validity of certain expected claims. These estimates may change as new information becomes available and it is reasonably possible that they may materially change from the estimated amounts. Increases in estimated costs to settle claims and decreases in estimated assets available for distribution may result in additional material charges. At the same time, any future decreases in estimated costs to settle claims or increases in estimated assets available for distribution may result in a gain, which would reduce our estimated charges. See Note 2: Canada Wind-down for additional information.
In the six months ended July 29, 2023, we recognized a liability for certain Nordstrom, Inc. guarantees related to a portion of Nordstrom Canada leases. The estimated liability is our current best estimate and is based on expectations that claims will be asserted against us and negotiated settlements will be reached, and not on any determination that it is probable that we would be found liable were these claims to be litigated and for how much.
To assess the estimated fair value of our Nordstrom Canada investment and our related-party receivables, we estimated the assets available for distribution in relation to expected claims. At the time of filing, the estimated amount of Nordstrom Canada’s liabilities exceeded the estimated fair value of assets available for distribution to creditors, and in relation to the receivables, we may not recover any proceeds. As a result, our fair value was recorded as zero in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of April 29, 2023. As of July 29, 2023, based on currently available information, there have been no significant changes in our estimates.
Canada Wind-down
 have the greatest potential effect on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. Our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit & Finance Committee of our Board of Directors. There have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies or critical accounting estimates as described in our 2022 Annual Report, except as noted below, and the following should be read in conjunction with Note 2: Canada Wind-down in Item 1.
Annual Report
We base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies referred to in our 2022 
The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires that we make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.

 Other adjusting items to reconcile net earnings to Adjusted EBITDAR as defined by our Revolver covenant include interest income, certain non-cash charges and other gains and losses where relevant. For the four quarters ended July 29, 2023, other Revolver covenant adjustments primarily include a supply chain impairment charge. See our 2022 Annual Report for detailed information on certain non-operating related adjustments.

Amortization of developer reimbursements is a non-cash reduction of Operating Lease Cost and is therefore added back to Operating Lease Cost for purposes of our Revolver covenant calculation.

Adjusted debt to EBITDAR is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, debt to net earnings, net earnings, debt or other GAAP financial measures. Our method of calculating a non-GAAP financial measure may differ from other companies’ methods and therefore may not be comparable to those used by other companies. The financial measure calculated under GAAP which is most directly comparable to Adjusted debt to EBITDAR is debt to net earnings. The following shows the components to reconcile the debt to net earnings calculation to Adjusted debt to EBITDAR:
Adjusted debt to EBITDAR is one of our key financial metrics and we believe that our debt levels are best analyzed using this measure, as it provides a reflection of our creditworthiness which could impact our credit ratings and borrowing costs. This metric is calculated in accordance with the updates in our Revolver covenant and is a key component in assessing whether our revolving credit facility is secured or unsecured, as well as our ability to make dividend payments and share repurchases. Our goal is to manage debt levels to achieve and maintain investment-grade credit ratings while operating with an efficient capital structure. For more information regarding our Revolver, see Note 4: Debt and Credit Facilities in Item 1.

On March 1, 2023, we amended our Revolver agreement. See Note 2: Canada Wind-down in Item 1.
As of July 29, 2023, we were in compliance with all covenants. We have certain limitations with respect to the payment of dividends and share repurchases under our Revolver agreement. For more information about our Revolver covenants, see Note 4: Debt and Credit Facilities in Item 1.
Should the ratings assigned to our long-term debt improve, the applicable margin associated with any borrowings under the Revolver may decrease, resulting in a lower borrowing cost under this facility. Conversely, should the ratings assigned to our long-term debt worsen, the applicable margin associated with any borrowings under the Revolver may increase, resulting in a higher borrowing cost under this facility.

For our Revolver, the interest rate applicable to any borrowings we may enter into depends upon the type of borrowing incurred plus an applicable margin, which is determined based on our credit ratings. At the time of this report, our credit ratings and outlook were as follows:
Changes in our credit ratings may impact our costs to borrow, whether our personal property secures our Revolver and whether and to what extent we are permitted to pay dividends or conduct share repurchases.
Impact of Credit Ratings and Revolver Covenants
As of July 29, 2023, we had total short-term borrowing capacity of $800 under the Revolver that expires in May 2027. As of July 29, 2023, we had no borrowings outstanding under our Revolver and no issuances outstanding under our commercial paper program.

Free Cash Flow is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, operating cash flows or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our method of calculating a non-GAAP financial measure may differ from other companies’ methods and therefore may not be comparable to those used by other companies. The financial measure calculated under GAAP which is most directly comparable to Free Cash Flow is net cash provided by operating activities. The following is a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to Free Cash Flow:
Free Cash Flow is one of our key liquidity measures and, when used in conjunction with GAAP measures, we believe it provides investors with a meaningful analysis of our ability to generate cash from our business.

We repurchased $1 for the six months ended July 29, 2023, compared with $35 in the six months ended July 30, 2022.
Share Repurchases
Net cash used in financing activities decreased $30 for the six months ended July 29, 2023, compared with the same period in 2022, primarily due to decreased share repurchases.
Financing Activities
Deferred property incentives are included in our cash provided by operations in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in Item 1. We operationally view the property incentives we receive from our developers and vendors as an offset to our capital expenditures.

Our capital expenditures, net are summarized as follows:
Capital Expenditures
Net cash used in investing activities increased $96 for the six months ended July 29, 2023, compared with the same period in 2022, primarily due to the sale of our interest in a corporate office building in 2022 and the decrease in cash and cash equivalents resulting from the deconsolidation of Canada in 2023 (see Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Note 2: Canada Wind-down in Item 1).
Investing Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities increased $92 for the six months ended July 29, 2023 due to lower compensation payments in 2023 compared with 2022, partially offset by the timing of purchases and payments for inventory.

The following is a summary of our cash flows by activity:
We ended the second quarter of 2023 with $885 in cash and cash equivalents and $800 of additional liquidity available on our Revolver. Cash and cash equivalents in the second quarter of 2023 increased from $494 in the second quarter of 2022, driven by cash flow from earnings, partially offset by capital expenditures and dividends. We believe that our operating cash flows are sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the next 12 months and beyond. Our cash requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant and opportunities arise and we may elect to raise additional funds in the future through the issuance of either debt or equity.
We strive to maintain a level of liquidity sufficient to allow us to cover our seasonal cash needs and to maintain appropriate levels of short-term borrowings. In the short term, our ongoing working capital and capital expenditure requirements, and any dividend payments or share repurchases, are generally funded through cash flows generated from operations. In addition, we have access to the commercial paper market and can draw on our Revolver for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. Over the long term, we manage our cash and capital structure to maximize shareholder return, maintain our financial position, manage refinancing risk and allow flexibility for strategic initiatives. We regularly assess our debt and leverage levels, capital expenditure requirements, debt service payments, dividend payouts, share repurchases and other future investments.

Non-operating related adjustments primarily relate to the wind-down of our Canadian operations for the trailing twelve-month period ended July 29, 2023 and the gain on sale of our interest in a corporate office building for the trailing twelve-month period ended July 30, 2022.

 For leases with property incentives that exceed the ROU assets, we reclassify the amount from assets to other current liabilities and other liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The current and noncurrent amounts are used to reduce average total assets above, as this better reflects how we manage our business.

Adjusted estimated income tax expense is calculated by multiplying the adjusted net operating profit by the adjusted effective tax rate (which removes the impact of non-operating related adjustments) for the trailing twelve-month periods ended July 29, 2023 and July 30, 2022. The adjusted effective tax rate is calculated by dividing adjusted income tax by adjusted earnings before income taxes for the same trailing twelve-month periods.

Non-operating related adjustments primarily relate to the wind-down of our Canadian operations and a supply chain impairment charge for the four quarters ended July 29, 2023 and the gain on sale of our interest in a corporate office building for the four quarters ended July 30, 2022. See the Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA section, as well as our 2022 Annual Report, for detailed information on certain non-operating related adjustments.

 Operating lease interest is a component of operating lease cost recorded in occupancy costs. We add back operating lease interest for purposes of calculating adjusted net operating profit for consistency with the treatment of interest expense on our debt.

Adjusted ROIC is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, return on assets, net earnings, total assets or other GAAP financial measures. Our method of calculating a non-GAAP financial measure may differ from other companies’ methods and therefore may not be comparable to those used by other companies. The financial measure calculated under GAAP which is most directly comparable to Adjusted ROIC is return on assets. The following shows the components to reconcile the return on assets calculation to Adjusted ROIC: 
Beginning in the second quarter of 2023, the Adjusted ROIC calculation was updated to exclude certain items that we do not consider representative of our core operating performance. Refer to non-operating related adjustments included within adjusted net operating profit after tax and adjusted average invested capital. Prior periods have been modified to conform with current period presentation.
We believe that Adjusted ROIC is a useful financial measure for investors in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of the capital we have invested in our business to generate returns over time. In addition, we have incorporated it in our executive incentive measures and we believe it is an important indicator of shareholders’ return over the long term.

The following is a reconciliation of net earnings (loss) to Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA and net earnings as a percent of net sales to Adjusted EBIT margin:
Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT margin and Adjusted EPS are not measures of financial performance under GAAP and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, net earnings, net earnings as a percent of net sales, operating cash flows, earnings per share, earnings per diluted share or other financial measures performed in accordance with GAAP. Our method of determining non-GAAP financial measures may differ from other companies’ financial measures and therefore may not be comparable to methods used by other companies. 
The following are key financial metrics and, when used in conjunction with GAAP measures, we believe they provide useful information for evaluating our core business performance, enable comparison of financial results across periods and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management for financial and operational decision-making. Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT margin and Adjusted EPS exclude certain items that we do not consider representative of our core operating performance. The financial measure calculated under GAAP which is most directly comparable to Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA is net earnings (loss). The financial measure calculated under GAAP which is most directly comparable to Adjusted EBIT margin is net earnings as a percent of net sales. The financial measure calculated under GAAP which is most directly comparable to Adjusted EPS is diluted EPS.

In fiscal 2023, which includes a 53rd week, we expect total revenue, including retail sales and credit card revenues, to decline 4 to 6 percent compared with fiscal 2022. Our outlook includes approximately 250 basis points of negative impact from the wind-down of business operations in Canada (see Note 2: Canada Wind-down) and approximately 130 basis points of positive impact from the 53rd week.
Fiscal Year 2023 Total Revenue Outlook
Credit card revenues, net increased $6 and $20 for the second quarter and six months ended July 29, 2023, compared with the same periods in 2022. The increases were due to higher revenue recognized in connection with our 2022 TD program agreement amendment and higher finance charges from both higher rates and outstanding balances. The increases were partially offset by increased credit losses.

During the six months ended July 29, 2023, we opened seven Nordstrom Rack stores, relocated one Nordstrom Rack store and closed one Nordstrom Rack store. We deconsolidated six Nordstrom and seven Nordstrom Rack stores in Canada as of March 2, 2023 (see Note 2: Canada Wind-down in Item 1). Subsequent to the end of the second quarter of 2023, we opened one Nordstrom Rack store and closed one Nordstrom store.
Total Company digital sales decreased for the second quarter and six months ended July 29, 2023, compared with the same periods in 2022. Eliminating store fulfillment for Nordstrom Rack digital orders during the third quarter of 2022 and sunsetting Trunk Club in the second quarter of 2022 negatively impacted digital sales by approximately 500 basis points for the second quarter of 2023 and approximately 650 basis points for the six months ended July 29, 2023. The timing of the Anniversary Sale had a negative impact on digital sales of approximately 300 basis points for the second quarter of 2023 and approximately 200 basis points for the six months ended July 29, 2023, compared with the same periods in 2022.
Nordstrom Rack net sales decreased for the second quarter and six months ended July 29, 2023, compared with the same periods in 2022, which reflected a decrease in the number of items sold, partially offset by an increase in the average selling price per item sold. Eliminating store fulfillment for Nordstrom Rack digital orders during the third quarter of 2022 negatively impacted Nordstrom Rack sales by approximately 500 basis points for both the second quarter and six months ended July 29, 2023, compared with the same periods in 2022.
Nordstrom net sales and GMV decreased for the second quarter and six months ended July 29, 2023, compared with the same periods in 2022. Nordstrom net sales for the second quarter of 2023, compared with the second quarter of 2022, were negatively impacted by 400 basis points from the wind-down of Canadian operations and approximately 300 basis points due to the timing shift of the Anniversary Sale. Nordstrom net sales for the six months ended July 29, 2023, compared with the same period in 2022, were negatively impacted 340 basis points from the wind-down of Canadian operations and approximately 100 basis points due to the timing shift of the Anniversary Sale. For both the quarter and six months ended July 29, 2023, Nordstrom net sales reflected a decrease in the number of items sold, partially offset by an increase in the average selling price per item sold.

Total Company net sales and GMV decreased for the quarter and six months ended July 29, 2023, compared with the same periods in 2022. For the second quarter of 2023, 275 basis points of the decrease was due to the deconsolidation of our Canadian operations as of March 2, 2023 (see Note 2: Canada Wind-down). Approximately 200 basis points of the decrease in the second quarter of 2023 was due to the timing shift of the Anniversary Sale, with one week shifting from the second quarter in 2022 to the third quarter in 2023. Total Company net sales for the six months ended July 29, 2023, compared with the same period in 2022, were negatively impacted 230 basis points from the wind-down of Canadian operations and approximately 100 basis points due to the timing shift of the Anniversary Sale.

The following table summarizes net sales:
Net Sales
 calculated as the trailing 4-quarter merchandise cost of sales divided by the trailing 13-month average inventory. Inventory turnover rate is an indicator of our success in optimizing inventory volumes in accordance with customer demand. Prior to the first quarter of 2023, we calculated inventory turnover rate as the trailing 4-quarter cost of sales and related buying and occupancy costs divided by the trailing 4-quarter average inventory.
Inventory Turnover Rate:
•
 calculated as the total dollar value of merchandise sold through our digital platforms and stores. GMV includes net merchandise sales from inventory we own, as well as the retail value of merchandise sold under our unowned inventory models with our vendors. We use GMV as an indicator of the scale and growth of our operations and the impact of our unowned inventory models. Prior to the first quarter of 2023, we also included non-merchandise sales in our GMV calculation.
GMV:

We monitor a number of key operating metrics to evaluate our Company’s performance. In addition to net sales, net earnings (loss) and other results under GAAP, two other key operating metrics we use are GMV and inventory turnover rate. Beginning in the first quarter of 2023, we made changes to how we calculate these metrics to more closely align with how our business is operated. Changes in the methodologies are discussed below and prior periods have been adjusted to reflect a comparable presentation. 
Our Anniversary Sale, historically the largest event of the year, typically falls in the second quarter. One week of our Anniversary Sale shifted from the second quarter in 2022 to the third quarter in 2023. 
In our ongoing effort to enhance the customer experience, we are focused on providing a seamless retail experience across our Company. We invested early in integrating our operations, merchandising and technology across our stores and online in both our Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack banners. By connecting our digital and physical assets across Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack, we are able to better serve customers when, where and how they want to shop. We have one Retail reportable segment and analyze our results on a total Company basis, using customer, market share, operational and net sales metrics.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

We made solid progress against each of our priorities, which we believe will help us expand market share and improve profitability. We believe continued focus and execution will help us navigate through the near-term uncertain environment and drive incremental improvement over the remainder of the year, and position us well to build capabilities to better serve our customers, drive profitable growth and increase shareholder value.
We continue to make significant progress on our supply chain initiatives, which drive improvements in customer experience and profitability. We delivered a better experience to our customers through faster delivery, especially during our Anniversary Sale. We continue to increase productivity throughout our network and reduce transportation costs. For the fourth consecutive quarter, variable supply chain costs fell by over 100 basis points compared with the prior year, helping to mitigate overall SG&A deleverage on lower sales. Supply chain is the largest component of our SG&A expenses, and we believe there is more opportunity to improve our efficiency and help drive overall expense leverage as sales improve. 
Supply Chain Optimization – 
We are focused on better inventory discipline to provide customers with relevant and new assortments and improve our earnings and returns on invested capital. We continue to manage with leaner inventories, with overall inventory levels 18% lower than the second quarter of 2022. We also improved sell-through and had faster turns across most of our categories. In the second quarter, we made progress on reducing our Designer inventory and we will continue to right size to the shift in consumer demand in this category. 
Inventory Productivity – 
 Consistent with our customer promise to deliver great brands at great prices, we continued to increase the penetration of our top performing strategic brands. We expanded our reach and convenience for customers by opening eight new stores and relocating one store year to date through September 1, 2023. We believe that Rack stores are a great investment, with returns that exceed our cost of capital and have a short payback period, and they are also our largest source of new customer acquisition. We are excited to roll out to more markets and increase our Rack footprint and have announced plans to open 23 more stores, including 11 later this year.
Nordstrom Rack –
We are encouraged by the progress we are making as a result of our focus on our key priorities. We are committed to delivering profitable growth while improving the customer experience through our key priorities.
Our Anniversary Sale is a unique event that rewards and engages our loyal customers with brand new products from the best brands at reduced prices for a limited time. Total Anniversary event sales, including the eight days that fall into the fiscal third quarter of 2023, were 5% lower compared with Anniversary event sales in 2022. Our Anniversary Sale had very strong inventory sell-through, with a 15% increase over last year’s event, helping to put us in a better inventory position as we enter the second half of the year.
Total Company net sales decreased 8.3% compared with the second quarter of 2022 and included negative impacts of 275 basis points from the wind-down of Canadian operations and approximately 200 basis points from one week of the Anniversary Sale shifting into the third quarter of 2023. We had sequential improvement in sales trends at both Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack from the first quarter of 2023, and most categories also improved sequentially from the first quarter of 2023, when compared with the same period in 2022. 
Second quarter results reflected continued progress on our 2023 key priorities of improving Nordstrom Rack performance, increasing our inventory productivity and optimizing our supply chain capabilities. We reported net earnings of $137, or $0.84 per diluted share. Earnings before interest and income taxes was $192 and 5.3% as a rate of sales in the second quarter of 2023, compared with EBIT of $202 and 5.1% as a rate of sales during the same period in 2022.

We have certain investments that are measured at fair value using the NAV per share, or its equivalent, as a practical expedient. This class of investments consists of partnership interests that mainly invest in venture capital strategies with a focus on privately held consumer and technology companies. The NAV is based on the fair value of the underlying net assets owned by the fund and the relative interest of each participating investor in the fair value of the underlying assets. Our interest in these partnerships is generally not redeemable and is subject to significant restrictions regarding transfers. Distributions from each fund will be received as the underlying assets of the funds are liquidated. Liquidation is triggered by clauses within the partnership agreements or at the funds’ stated end date. The contractual terms of the partnership interests range from

In the first quarter of 2023, we measured our investment in Nordstrom Canada, our related-party receivables and related lease guarantees at fair value (see Note 2: Canada Wind-down for additional information). 
We measure certain non-financial assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, primarily goodwill, long-lived tangible and ROU assets, in connection with periodic evaluations for potential impairment. We estimate the fair value of these assets and liabilities using primarily unobservable inputs and, as such, these are considered Level 3 fair value measurements.

The following table summarizes the carrying value and fair value estimate of our long-term debt, including current maturities:
Long-term debt is recorded at carrying value. If long-term debt was measured at fair value, we would use quoted market prices of the same or similar issues, which is considered a Level 2 fair value measurement. 
Financial instruments measured at carrying value on a recurring basis include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and our Revolver, which approximate fair value due to their short-term nature.

On March 1, 2023, we amended our Revolver originally dated May 6, 2022. Prior to this amendment, Nordstrom Canada Retail, Inc. was a loan party under the Revolver and the obligations under the Revolver were secured, in part, by the assets of this subsidiary. As a result of this amendment, Nordstrom Canada Retail, Inc. was removed as a loan party and obligations under the Revolver are no longer secured by these assets. In addition, this amendment excludes as subsidiaries or affiliates all Nordstrom Canada entities and carves out certain CCAA-related expenses and obligations from financial covenants under the Revolver.
Amendment of Revolver Agreement
All our estimates are dependent on the outcome of the Nordstrom Canada wind-down process, including the amount of third-party and Nordstrom claims asserted and recognized in the claims process, the amount of assets available for distribution, the negotiation of a CCAA plan of arrangement approved by the creditors and the Ontario Superior Court of Justice and the outcome of negotiations regarding the leases. We continue to work through the wind-down process and our estimates of losses are based on currently available information and our assessment of the validity of certain expected claims. These estimates may change as new information becomes available and it is reasonably possible that they may materially change from the estimated amounts. Increases in estimated costs to settle claims and decreases in estimated assets available for distribution may result in additional material charges. At the same time, any future decreases in estimated costs to settle claims or increases in estimated assets available for distribution may result in a gain, which would reduce our estimated charges.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires that we make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities during the reporting period. Uncertainties regarding such estimates and assumptions are inherent in the preparation of financial statements and actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. Our most significant accounting judgments and estimates include revenue recognition, inventory valuation, long-lived asset recoverability, income taxes and contingent liabilities, including assumptions related to our Canada wind-down, all of which involve assumptions about future events.
 
Use of Estimates
Results for any one quarter are not indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year. We plan our merchandise purchases and receipts to coincide with expected sales trends. For instance, our merchandise purchases and receipts increase prior to the Anniversary Sale and in the fall as we prepare for the holiday shopping season (typically from November through December). Consistent with our seasonal fluctuations, our working capital requirements have historically increased during the months leading up to the Anniversary Sale and the holidays as we purchase inventory in anticipation of increased sales.
Our business, like that of other retailers, is subject to seasonal fluctuations and cyclical trends in consumer spending. Our sales are typically higher in our second quarter, which usually includes most of our Anniversary Sale, and in the fourth quarter due to the holidays. One week of our Anniversary Sale shifted from the second quarter in 2022 to the third quarter in 2023.
Seasonality
We operate on a 52/53-week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to January 31st. References to 2023 relate to the 53-week fiscal year ending February 3, 2024. References to any other years included within this document are based on a 52-week fiscal year.
