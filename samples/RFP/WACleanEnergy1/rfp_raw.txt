1. INTRODUCTION
PURPOSE AND BACKGROUND
The Washington State Department of COMMERCE, hereafter called “COMMERCE,’ will be accepting
grant applications for the Clean Energy Fund (CEF) Research, Development, and Demonstration
(RD&D) Program from entities seeking funds for clean energy projects focused on new and emerging
technologies.
The Washington State Legislature created the Clean Energy Fund to fund projects that provide a
public benefit through the deployment of clean energy technologies that save energy and reduce
energy costs, reduce harmful air emissions, or increase energy independence for the state. The
RD&D program within the Clean Energy Fund 5 (CEF 5) is authorized in subsection (a) 9 of 1064 of
the Substitute House Bill 1080 to distribute $3.9 million through competitive grants. Where the
department deems applicable, Commerce also reserves the right to award funding under sub-section
11 of 1017 of Substitute Senate Bill 5200, and previous funding from the legislature.
Proviso language mandates that projects must be consistent with the 2021 State Energy Strategy
adopted under chapter 43.21F RCW and policies under chapter 19.405 RCW (Clean Energy
Transformation Act). The 2021 State Energy Strategy (2021 SES) provides guidelines and a roadmap
for meeting the state’s greenhouse gas emission limits required under the Energy Independence Act
(RCW 19.285). Other policies such as the Clean Energy Transformation Act (CETA), signed into law
in 2019, requires Washington to develop an electricity supply that is 100% renewable or non-emitting
by 2045.
The State Energy Strategy acknowledges the need for continued investment in research and
development of new technologies to contribute to the state’s climate policy goals. This program funds
projects that support these goals through strategic research and development for new and emerging
clean energy generation and storage technologies and climate change mitigation technologies, which
may include greenhouse gas removal. Both the State Energy Strategy and CETA also support the
equitable distribution of benefits, and an inclusive transition, which this program has attempted to
incorporate through the program design (see 1.2 Objectives and Scope of Work).
COMMERCE intends to award multiple contract(s) to provide the services described in this RFA.
This solicitation will utilize a two-phase application process (see RFA Section 3.1 TWO PHASE
APPLICATION PROCESS for more detail).
OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE OF WORK
Grants should be used to leverage federal or non-state funds to research, develop, and demonstrate
clean energy technologies, that are new or emerging, have demonstrated viability, but not
commercialization, and have expanded existing technologies through innovation, such as novel
configurations or increased efficiencies. The funds are intended to catalyze diverse new technologies
that change the production, use, storage, and transportation of energy.
Desired program outcomes include increasing investment in innovation and strategic research of
eligible new and emerging clean energy technologies that help meet state and broader climate goals,
reduce reliance on fossil fuels, reduce risk of irregularities in power supply, offer opportunities for
economic and job growth, and strengthen technology supply chains. These technologies should also
reduce harmful air emissions, reduce energy costs, or increase energy independence for the state.
Goals for this solicitation include:
 Increasing opportunity for Washington-based organizations to participate in federal opportunities
by providing cost share or match funding assistance,
 Leveraging non-state funding to help grow Washington’s clean technology sector, and
 Developing and strengthening partnerships and new technologies in the clean energy sector.
P a g e | 2
The 2021 State Energy Strategy, a Request for Information, and recommendations from the Energy
and Climate Policy Advisory Committee (ECPAC) have informed and guided the design of the 2023
RD&D program. This program also aligns with state and federal energy priorities by funding
advancements in research, innovation, demonstration, and industrial efficiencies to meet clean
energy goals around decarbonization. Washington state entities could leverage funding to match
upcoming federal opportunities available through the Infrastructure Investment & Jobs Act (IIJA)
and/or the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA.)
In accordance with the proviso and state policy goals, Commerce will prioritize projects that benefit
vulnerable populations and overburdened communities, including Tribes and communities with high
environmental or energy burdens. Equity outcomes will be prioritized through application scoring. To
encourage equitable and beneficial impacts for Tribes and communities with high environmental or
energy burdens, this solicitation will prioritize projects that:
 Establish a partnership, include co-creation, or ensure a formal advisory role for Tribes or
organizations serving overburdened communities.
 Create new economic development opportunities.
 Develop a community benefits plan that reflects community desires and needs through
demonstrated outreach, engagement, and consultation.
 Reduce emissions; increase access to clean energy, and/or resilience for communities or Tribes.
 Include risk mitigation plans that also address adverse consequences to communities and the
environment.
Commerce may also prioritize projects that build on Washington’s strengths in communities,
aerospace, maritime, information and communications technology, grid modernization, advanced
materials, and decarbonizing the built environment. Commerce also reserves the right to prioritize
projects and make award recommendations that increase geographic diversity of clean energy
projects.
The above bullets will be reflected in the scoring criteria. Projects are still eligible to apply for funding
if they do not provide benefits to the priority groups mentioned.
Eligible Technologies
This program funds research, development and demonstration of new and emerging clean energy
generation and storage technologies and climate change technologies including greenhouse gas
removal. Eligible projects must be consistent with the recommendations put forth the in the 2021
State Energy Strategy and Washington state clean energy policies including Chapter 19.405 RCW. If
you apply to fund a technology or research that is not explicitly supported by the 2021 SES or other
policy goals, please be prepared to explain how it supports state clean energy policy.
Where the department deems applicable and aligned with the 23-25 RDD proviso, the department
may make awards that meet the intent of the following,
“grants for strategic research, development, and demonstration of new and emerging clean
energy generation and storage technologies and climate change mitigation technologies,
including greenhouse gas removal. Grants awarded under this subsection must reduce reliance
on fossil fuels, reduce risk of irregularities in power supply, offer opportunities for economic and
job growth, and strengthen technology supply chains. Grant funds are intended to catalyze
diverse new technologies that change the production, use, storage, and transportation of energy.
The department may provide funding to projects at various stages of readiness, including early-
stage research, pilot and demonstration projects, and dual-use projects that produce clean
energy and additional benefits.”
The following technologies will be prioritized through the scoring criteria (listed in alphabetical order):
 Advanced Bioenergy, Biofuels, and Biorefining
 Advanced Energy Storage, Battery Recycling, and Battery Technologies
 Development of New Earth Abundant, and Lightweight Materials
P a g e | 3
 Energy Efficiency
 Greenhouse Gas Removal and Sequestration Technologies
 Renewable Energy
 Recycling Energy System Components
 Renewable Hydrogen Storage, Distribution, and Dispensing
Other technologies beyond what is listed above that meet state policy goals including Chapter
19.405 RCW and align with the 2021 State Energy Strategy are eligible. These other technologies
will receive fewer points than the prioritized technologies.
Technology Readiness Level (TRL) (Please refer to Exhibit E of the RFA).
Grants under this program aim to support technologies between the pilot or prototype stage and
commercialization and are not meant to support commercialized technologies. Projects between TRL
range of 4-7 will receive additional points.
Examples of Ineligible Projects that are inconsistent with state policy goals include:
 Coal, oil, natural gas, or projects in which the primary focus involves these fossil fuels are
ineligible.
 Nuclear is ineligible.
 Projects that do not illustrate research, development or demonstration of a new technology or
improve on proven technologies are ineligible.
 Projects that install available systems infrastructure or implement systems of proven,
commercial technologies, without improving on those technologies are ineligible.
 Conventional and commercially available technology is ineligible unless there is an inherent
innovative application and such technology is integral to this approach).
Examples of Ineligible Expenses
 Property purchases and leases, or activities related to site selection or acquisition;
 Equipment purchases for capital assets that would not be completed during the grant
performance period (see Section 1.5 PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE);
 Buildings and structures;
 Rolling stock and other non-capital assets;
 Software upgrades and maintenance agreements;
 Standalone software not developed as part of the integration of aforementioned technologies.
 Maintenance and or replacement of existing assets that are not integral to the integration of
aforementioned technologies.
 Grant Application development for future State or other funding applications.
Applicant pools will be divided into two tracks (Track 1 and Track 2) (see Section 1.4 for more detail
on each track including eligibility). Both tracks will utilize a two-phase process to alleviate the
administrative burden on less-resourced applicants and to encourage new applicants. Each primary
Applicant may only submit one application for each Track and in turn may only receive one grant
award as the primary grantee per Track. There is no limit to the number of applications that an

details.
Two-Phase Application Process Overview
Phase One Process:
 PHASE ONE: Part A and Part B will be screened for minimum qualifications. COMMERCE staff
will review PHASE ONE: Part A and Part B to determine whether it was properly completed,
submitted on time, and whether it addresses and aligns with the minimum qualifications described
in RFA SECTION 1.3 MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS.

 PHASE ONE: Part A and Part B applications that do not pass the minimum qualifications screening
will receive an email indicating they were administratively disqualified. If the project meets the
minimum thresholds, the PHASE ONE: Part C application will be evaluated.
 An evaluation Team will review PHASE ONE applications in their entirety and assign a numerical
score based on the criteria listed in SECTION 4.2 EVALUATION BREAKDOWN. COMMERCE staff
will use the scores to issue “ENCOURAGE” or “DISCOURAGE” notices to applicants but will not
release individual scores as part of the determination.
o Favorably reviewed applicants will be notified via email with a recommendation of
“Encouraged to submit PHASE TWO Application”
o Unfavorably reviewed applicants will be notified via email a recommendation of
“Discouraged to submit PHASE TWO Application.”
 Applicants will not receive feedback on the recommendation. Applicants will not receive an
indication of the level of anticipated award since this will be determined in the Phase Two review.
Applicants will not be provided an opportunity for project presentations or to request meetings or
phone calls to discuss the projects at this stage. Applicants who were “Discouraged” can submit a
PHASE TWO Application. However, the Evaluation Team will only review a limited number of
PHASE TWO applications, and will prioritize reviewing the applicants receiving an “Encouraged”
recommendation.
 Discouraged applicants who chose to submit an application are not guaranteed an application
review. The “Encouraged” or “Discouraged” decision is intended to minimize the time and effort to
develop a PHASE TWO Application for projects that do not meet the intent of the program or have
a low chance of success.
Phase Two Process:
 Applicants will have approximately 65 calendar days from the receipt of the “Encouraged” or
“Discouraged” email to submit a PHASE TWO Application. As stated in SECTION 2.2 ESTIMATED
SCHEDULE OF PROCUREMENT ACTIVITIES, COMMERCE reserves the right to revise the
schedule at any time, and applicants may have fewer than 65 calendar days to prepare the PHASE
TWO Application. Submitting a PHASE ONE Application does not obligate the applicant to submit
a PHASE TWO Application. However, applicants must submit a PHASE ONE Application to be
eligible for consideration for the PHASE TWO application.
 An Evaluation Team will evaluate PHASE TWO of Encouraged Applicants, including reviewing
PHASE ONE part C for context.
 Scores, comments, and recommendations will be provided to COMMERCE for consideration when
determining awards. COMMERCE will make all final funding decisions. Notification of Research,
Development and Demonstration Program grant awards, along with notification of unsuccessful
applications, will take place approximately according to the schedule in SECTION 2.2 ESTIMATED
SCHEDULE OF PROCUREMENT ACTIVITIES.
 Successful applicants will enter into contract negotiations starting according to the schedule in
SECTION 2.2 ESTIMATED SCHEDULE OF PROCUREMENT ACTIVITIES.

VIRTUAL PRESENTATIONS MAY BE REQUIRED
After evaluating the written Applications COMMERCE may elect to schedule virtual presentations or
interviews of top-scoring Applicants. If so, COMMERCE will contact the top-scoring Applicants from the
written evaluation to schedule a date and time to meet on a platform such as Zoom or Microsoft Teams.
Any commitments made by the Applicant during a virtual presentation or interview will be considered
binding.
The scores from the written evaluation and the virtual presentation combined together will determine
the Apparent Successful Contractor.
NOTIFICATION TO APPLICANTS
COMMERCE will notify the Apparent Successful Contractor(s) of their selection in writing upon
completion of the evaluation process. Applicants who were not selected for further negotiation or award
will be notified separately. Notification may also be made to the COMMERCE public website,
Washington Electronic Business Solution (WEBS), or other publically accessible locations.
DEBRIEFING OF UNSUCCESSFUL APPLICANTS
Any Applicant who has submitted a Application and received notice that they were not selected for
contract negotiation may request a debriefing. The request for a debriefing conference must be received
by the RFA Coordinator within three (3) business days after the Unsuccessful Applicant Notification is
e-mailed to the Applicant. The debriefing must be scheduled within three (3) business days of the
request.
Discussion at the debriefing conference is strictly limited to the following:
 Evaluation and scoring of that Applicant’s Application;
 Any written comments from evaluators related to that Applicant;
 Review of Applicant’s final score in comparison with the other final scores without identifying
the other Applicants or reviewing their Applications.
Comparisons between Applications or evaluations of the other Applications is not allowed.
COMMERCE will not discuss any items other than the three bullet points above. Debriefing conferences
may be conducted on the telephone or by other electronic means and will be scheduled for a maximum
of thirty (30) minutes. COMMERCE reserves the right to end a debriefing for any reason.
PROTEST PROCEDURE
Protests may be filed only by Applicants who submitted a response to this RFA and who have
participated in a debriefing conference. Upon completing the debriefing conference, the Applicant is
allowed five (5) business days to file a protest with the RFA Coordinator. Protests must be received by
the RFA Coordinator no later than 5:00pm Pacific time on the fifth business day following the debriefing.
Protests must be submitted by email. Applicants may choose to copy COMMERCE’S Central Contracts
Office at comcustserv@commerce.wa.gov. Do not copy any other COMMERCE staff.
Applicants protesting this RFA shall follow the procedures described below. Protests that do not follow
these procedures will not be considered. This protest procedure constitutes the sole administrative
remedy available to Applicants under this RFA.
All protests must be in writing, addressed to the RFA Coordinator, and signed by the protesting party
or an authorized agent. The protest must state the RFA number, the grounds for the protest from the
list below with specific facts, and complete statements of the action(s) being protested. A description
of the relief or corrective action being requested should also be included.
Only protests stipulating an issue of fact concerning the following subjects shall be considered:
P a g e | 21
 A matter of bias, discrimination, or conflict of interest on the part of an evaluator;
 Errors in computing the score;
 Non-compliance with procedures described in this RFA or COMMERCE policy.
Protests not based on procedural matters will not be considered. Protests will be dismissed as without
merit if they address issues such as an evaluator’s professional judgment on the quality of a Application,
or COMMERCE’S assessment of its own and/or other agencies’ needs or requirements.
Scores received are not a valid basis of protest and will be dismissed as without merit unless included
with facts supporting bias, discrimination, or conflict of interest on the part of an evaluator.
Upon receipt of a protest, a protest review will be held by COMMERCE. COMMERCE’S Chief Contracts
Officer, or other employee delegated by the Director who was not involved in the award process, will
consider the record along with all available facts and issue a decision within ten (10) business days of
receipt of the protest. If additional time is required, the protesting party will be notified of the delay.
In the event a protest may directly impact the actual interest of another Applicant, such Applicant may
be given an opportunity to submit its views and any relevant information on the protest.
The final determination of the protest shall:
 Find the protest lacking in merit and uphold COMMERCE’S action; or
 Find only technical or harmless errors in COMMERCE’S process and determine COMMERCE
to be in substantial compliance and reject the protest; or
