Can you provide more information about the current technology infrastructure and how it will interact with the new solution? Are there any current technology limitations that we should be aware of?\n\n4. Could you clarify the level of consulting services required for the development and maintenance of the automation test suite in support of Phase 1A?\n\n5. Can you share more detail about the expected security design review process and how it will be carried out before the Software License Agreement is signed?\n\n6. Could you provide further details about the level of collaboration expected with other vendors such as software vendors and system implementers?\n\n7. Can you specify the key milestones or deliverables you want to see throughout the contract period?\n\n8.
