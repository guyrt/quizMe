The current market value of these funds is approximately $8.0 billion.  A multi-asset class structure is employed in the management of the funds which includes domestic and international equity, fixed-income, absolute return funds, venture capital, buyout funds, real asset funds, and derivatives.  Most funds are managed by investment firms external to the University of Washington.  Additional detail on the University’s investment program can be viewed at  https://www.uwinco.uw.edu/ .\n\nUWINCO manages relationships with a varied mix of both existing and prospective fund managers.  UWINCO is searching for systems that can better institutionalize the investment process and relationship management, to enable better internal information collection, sharing, monitoring and reporting, both pre- and post-investment. \n\nCurrently, UWINCO uses a third-party vendor for its CRM. Functions used include contact management and recording of qualitative items (Meeting notes, etc.). Document management is performed in house through a manual process using MS Outlook and MS Windows file/folder structure. \n\nUWINCO uses Caissa for performance analytics & reporting and Northern Trust as Custodian.\n\n2.2\tPeriod of Service\n\nThe anticipated go-live for the solution is August 1, 2024 with the 5-year term commencing at that time.\n\nThe University shall contract for an initial five (5) year agreement with five (5) one-year options, for a total not to exceed ten (10) years, the firm and fixed pricing, commencing on the effective date of the Contract. Pricing information should include any additional charges or fees related to maintenance or service plans. In addition, include a cost breakdown for user support or trouble requests and change order requests on customized or ad hoc projects and tasks. Finally, pricing information should highlight variations, discounts, or incentives in pricing.  All pricing information should be summarized in Attachment J.\n\n2.3\tProposal Content, Requirements, and Instructions\n\nAll proposals will be submitted to the RFP Coordinator, per Section 1.2 above.  Vendor shall address each question below and describe any exceptions or limitations.  Vendor will limit its written responses to these questions to ten (10) pages excluding Attachments (and corresponding answers to Attachments E and F). \n\na)\tCover letter: Summary of proposal with signatures as outlined in Section 1.10.\n\nb)\tBackground and History:  Describe the company, organization, officers or partners, number of employees and any operating policies which would affect this Contract.  Describe the current firm ownership and state the number of years the organization has been continuously engaged in business.  Please detail any change in ownership or key leadership departures over the past 5 years.  Describe any future planned merger and/or acquisition activity.   \n\nc)\tFirm Experience and Credentials:  Provide evidence of Bidder’s experience in projects or providing products and services consistent with those outlined in the Scope of Work below.\n\nd)\tFinancial Stability:  Describe the financial status of the company.  Attach a copy of the most recent annual financial statement or other verifiable document that affirms the financial viability of the company.\n\ne)\tProject Team and Management Structure:  Identify proposed project team and management structure for completing the Scope of Work described below.  This should identify roles and responsibilities, including Bidder expectations of participating UW staff resources.  Provide resumes of key professional staff to be assigned to the project, both for implementation phase and training, and their level of commitment to this engagement.  Any portion of the work that is outsourced or performed by third-party contractors should be clearly identified.\n\nf)\tProposed Fees:  Provide a cost proposal to accomplish the Scope of Work or provide the requested product and include as Attachment J in the template provided.  Vendors may propose an integrated CRM/DMS solution, however the systems cost matrix must be completed individually, one cost matrix for DMS and one for CRM.

MWBE Participation Form\n\t\tE.  CRM DMS Use Case Questions.\n\t\tF. CRM DMS Information Security and Data Privacy Questions\n\t\tJ. Systems Cost Matrix\n\n\n2.4\tScope of Work\n\nBackground:  UWINCO currently uses a third-party software system (SAAS) to provide CRM functions including storage of contacts, notes, and other qualitative information.  Document management has largely been a manual function completed by the UWINCO team whereby all manager generated correspondence (Audited Financials, Statements, Newsletters, Notices, etc.) is directed to a dedicated email address or investor portal and saved to internal drives by a UWINCO team member.  \n\nFuture State and Scope:  UWINCO seeks to continue to use a CRM system for qualitative items, and potentially outsource and automate its document collection and storage through either a combined CRM/DMS solution or separate systems. Vendor offerings must reflect current generation technology/tools that have been adopted by institutional endowments and foundation clients.  A prospective CRM vendor may offer a standalone solution without an automated document collection module so long as their offering has been successfully integrated for other clients with another firm’s automated document collection offering (and vice versa).  Vendors must provide independent bids (i.e. no jointly submitted bids with other firms).  UWINCO may select all or a portion of a vendor offering to create an optimal CRM/DMS solution for its program.\n\nThe following requirements and potential features of a CRM and DMS system are highlighted below:\n\nCRM Requirements:\n\n•\tRepository of qualitative data\n•\tAbility to import history of qualitative manager information\n•\tFuture investment notes (meeting notes, statement/financials/periodic reporting notes)\n•\tFirmwide consolidated contacts\n•\tFree form search capabilities\n•\tMS 365 (Outlook) integration\n•\tAudit trail\n\nCRM Potential Features:\n\n•\tDashboards/workflows (pipeline/investment process, ops tracking, post investment monitoring)\n•\tFuture travel calendar\n•\tManager informational review/travel package\n•\tManager book extraction\n•\tUpload capability from various sources (.pdf, .xls, .doc, such as annual manager surveys)\n•\tSystemic retention/purge schedule\n•\tMobile app\n\nDMS Requirements:\n•\tAccurate processing, preferably using automation tools including machine learning and optical character recognition\n•\tSearch capabilities – ability to search managers, key words, phrases, regardless of type/file format of document including pdf, .xls, .doc\n•\tSearch returns that are concise and accurate\n•\tDaily reporting of items processed\n•\tStatus reporting, exception reports – ability for scheduled and ad hoc reporting of what has been received, and what has not been received (example: Quarterly Statements, what are we missing and what do we need to chase)\n•\tMultiple platform integration (Caissa, MS 365, Outlook)\n•\tDrag and drop file capabilities\n•\tWorkflow integration\n•\tPost receipt document modification (adding “sticky notes” on PDF’s etc.)\n\nSchedule Constraints\n\nImplementation to be completed by August 1, 2024. The current vendor contract runs through 9/10/2024 with August 2024 providing a buffer in the event of any unforeseen delays.\n\nProject Management Requirements\n\nIt is expected that the awarded Supplier will provide a dedicated implementation team to coordinate and implement the onboarding and initial training of UWINCO to the platform. It is also expected that the awarded Supplier will provide ongoing relationship management, servicing, and training.\n\nPersonnel Requirements and Expectations\n\nIt is expected that the awarded Supplier will support UWINCO during customary business hours for routine customer service inquiries.\n\n\n\nSECTION III  \nEVALUATION AND CONTRACT AWARD\n\n1.1\tEvaluation of Proposals\nThe University reserves the right to make Vendor selections based solely on the proposal submitted.  Responsive proposals will be evaluated strictly in accordance with the requirements stated in this solicitation and any addenda issued.  The evaluation of proposals shall be accomplished by an evaluation team to be designated by the UW, which will determine the ranking of the proposals.  The RFP Coordinator may contact the Vendor for clarification of any portion of a Vendor’s proposal.\n\n1.2\tInterview / Presentation\nAt its sole discretion, the University may require Vendors to participate in an interview or provide a presentation to the evaluation committee.  If so, the score from the interview and/or the presentation may be combined with the score of the proposal to identify the apparent successful Vendor.  The University will contact the Vendor directly to schedule the interview/presentation.  In addition, the University may request a separate meeting with a Vendor’s IT team to review/follow up on any answers provided in Attachment F.\n\n1.3\tEvaluation Criteria & Scoring\nSolution proposals will be evaluated and assigned points in the following categories: \n\n\nFunctional completeness, suitability, technical capabilities, information security, and flexibility of the application System.   25%\n\nTotal five-year cost of the proposed System, including the hardware, software, implementation, and other costs.  Please also state how the proposed option year pricing will be determined. 15%\n\nVendor support capabilities, experience, record of successful installations and product enhancements, commitment to the research and development of the product.  15%\n\nVendor’s demonstrated ability to provide a solution in a manner that aligns well with the mission, values, policies, and practices of the UW, considering factors such as references, testing, past experiences, and other information as may have a bearing on evaluating the Vendor’s ethical character, reputation, and judgment.  10%\n\nTechnical direction of the product, as indicated by Vendor’s responses. This technical evaluation will include an evaluation of the System’s flexibility to respond to the University’s needs, now and in the future.  10%\n\nMaturity and viability of the Vendor’s business model. 10%\n\nImplementation and draft work plan. 10%\n\nMinimal edits to standard UW legal forms. 5%\n\n1.4\t      Notification to Proposers\nOnce the final evaluation phase has been completed, the  RFP Coordinator will issue a written announcement to all participants, citing the name(s) of the apparent successful vendors.\n\n1.5\tProtest Procedure\nContractors protesting the award shall follow the procedures described below. Protests that do not follow these procedures shall not be considered. This protest procedure constitutes the sole administrative remedy available to Contractors under this procurement.\n\nAfter the announcement of the apparent successful Contractor, unsuccessful Contractors will be offered a debriefing upon written request.\n\n•\tContractors have 3 business days after the apparent successful Contractor is announced to request a debriefing.\n•\tContractors are required to participate in a debriefing as a prerequisite for submitting a protest.\n•\tContractors have 5 business days after their debriefing to file a written protest.\n•\tContractors may submit a protest based only on the following:\n\tA matter of bias, discrimination, or conflict of interest on the part of an evaluator;\n\tErrors in computing the scores; or\n\tNon-compliance with procedures described in the procurement document or UW protest process.\n\nProtests are to be submitted to the UW’s Director of Procurement Services (Director) and the RFP Coordinator.\n\nThe Director will issue a written response within 10 business days from receipt of the protest, unless additional time is needed. The protesting Contractor shall be notified if additional time is needed. The Director’s protest decision is final.\n\n \nSection IV\nAttachments\n\n1.\tAttachment A.\tData Processing Agreement\n\t\t\t\n \n\n2.\tAttachment B.\tConfidentiality Statement\n\t\t\tContractor to sign and return with proposal.\n \n\n3.\tAttachment C.\tMWBE Response Form\n\t\t\tContractor to sign and return with proposal.\n \n\t\t4.\tAttachment D.\tUniversity of Washington General Terms and Conditions\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\n5. \tAttachment E. \t CRM / DMS Use Case Questions\n\t\t\t \n\n6. \tAttachment F.\tCRM / DMS Information Security and Data Privacy Questions\n \n\t\t\t\n7. \tAttachment G. \tIT Accessibility Rider\n\n\t\t\t \n8. \tAttachment H.\tIT Security Terms\n\n\t\t\t\n9.
