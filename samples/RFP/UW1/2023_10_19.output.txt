The project in this Request for Proposal (RFP) is issued by the University of Washington (UW) on behalf of the University of Washington Investment Management Company (UWINCO). The project seeks proposals from qualified vendors to provide a Contact Relationship Management (CRM) solution and/or a Document Management System (DMS). The selected vendors are expected to support the University's requirements for efficient processing, analysis, and reporting of investment information.

The services are meant for UWINCO, which is responsible for the investment programs of the University, including its endowment and operating funds. The current market value of these funds is approximately $8.0 billion.

The vendors can propose an integrated CRM and DMS solution, or a standalone solution for either of the systems. The initial contract duration will be five years with the possibility of five one-year extensions. The anticipated go-live date for the solution is August 1, 2024.

The RFP also outlines the requirements for the solution, the criteria for evaluation, and the procedure for submitting proposals. Vendor's proposals should address specific questions outlined in the RFP, including company background and history, financial stability, project team and management structure, proposed fees, and references.
