Item 5.07.Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.
 
At a special meeting of stockholders of eMagin Corporation (the “Company”
or “eMagin”) held on August 31, 2023 (the “Special Meeting”), the Company’s stockholders voted to approve
the Company’s pending acquisition by affiliates of Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (“Parent”). As of
the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K, the transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2023, subject
to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals.
 
As of July 20, 2023, the
record date for the Special Meeting, there were 83,187,916 shares of Company’s outstanding common stock, $0.001 par value per share
(the “Company common stock”) and 5,356 shares of Company’s Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (“Company
Series B Convertible Preferred Stock”), convertible into 17,723,362 shares of Company common stock, outstanding and entitled
to vote at the Special Meeting. Each share of Company common stock is entitled to one vote on each matter presented for vote at the Special
Meeting. Each share of Company Series B Convertible Preferred Stock is entitled to voting rights equal to the number of shares of
Company common stock issuable upon conversion of the Company Series B Convertible Preferred Stock.
 
At the Special Meeting,
there were present, in person or by proxy, holders of 55,702,113 shares of the Company common stock, and holders of 17,723,362

common stock issued and outstanding, 100% of the shares of Company Series B Convertible Preferred Stock
issued and outstanding, and 72.76% of the shares of the Company common stock and Company Series B Convertible Preferred
Stock voting together as a single class on an as-converted to Company common stock basis as of the record date of the Special
Meeting and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, constituting a quorum for the transaction of business.

and Emerald Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Silk USA (“Merger Sub”). Pursuant

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
 
This Current Report on Form 8-K contains “forward-looking
statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements are based on the Company’s current
expectations, estimates and projections about the expected date of closing of the proposed transaction and the potential benefits thereof,
its business and industry, management’s beliefs and certain assumptions made by the Company and Parent, all of which are subject
to change. In this context, forward-looking statements often address expected future business and financial performance and financial
condition, and often contain words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,”
“could,” “seek,” “see,” “will,” “may,” “would,” “might,”
“potentially,” “estimate,” “continue,” “expect,” “target,” similar expressions
or the negatives of these words or other comparable terminology that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes. All forward-looking
statements by their nature address matters that involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, and are not guarantees
of future results, such as statements about the consummation of the proposed transaction and the anticipated benefits thereof. These and
other forward-looking statements, including the failure to consummate the proposed transaction or to make or take any filing or other
action required to consummate the proposed transaction in a timely matter or at all, are not guarantees of future results and are subject
to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking
statements. Accordingly, there are or will be important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated
in such statements and, therefore, and you should not place undue reliance on any such statements and caution must be exercised in relying
on forward-looking statements. Important risk factors that may cause such a difference include, but are not limited to: (i) the ability
of the parties to consummate the proposed transaction in a timely manner or at all; (ii) the satisfaction (or waiver) of closing
conditions to the consummation of the proposed transaction; (iii) potential delays in the consummation of the proposed transaction;
(iv) the ability of the Company to timely and successfully achieve the anticipated benefits of the proposed transaction; (v) the
occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance or condition that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement; (vi) the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the current conflict between the Russian Federation and Ukraine on the Company’s business and
general economic conditions; (vii) the Company’s ability to implement its business strategy; (viii) significant transaction
costs associated with the proposed transaction; (ix) potential litigation relating to the proposed transaction; (x) the risk
that disruptions from the proposed transaction will harm the Company’s business, including current plans and operations; (xi) the
ability of the Company to retain and hire key personnel; (xii) potential adverse reactions or changes to business relationships resulting
from the announcement or completion of the proposed transaction; (xiii) legislative, regulatory and economic developments affecting
the Company’s business; (xiv) general economic and market developments and conditions; (xv) the evolving legal, regulatory
and tax regimes under which the Company operates; (xvi) potential business uncertainty, including changes to existing business relationships,
during the pendency of the proposed transaction that could affect the Company’s financial performance; (xvii) restrictions
during the pendency of the proposed transaction that may impact the Company’s ability to pursue certain business opportunities or
strategic transactions; and (xviii) unpredictability and severity of catastrophic events, including, but not limited to, acts of
terrorism or outbreak of war or hostilities, as well as the Company’s response to any of the aforementioned factors. These risks,
as well as other risks associated with the proposed transaction, are more fully discussed in the Proxy Statement. Additional risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements
are included under the caption “Risk Factors” in the Company’s most recent annual and quarterly reports filed with the
SEC and any subsequent reports on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q or Form 8-K filed from time to time and available at www.sec.gov.
While the list of factors presented here is, and the list of factors presented in the Proxy Statement are, considered representative,
no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted factors may present significant
additional obstacles to the realization of forward-looking statements. Consequences of material differences in results as compared with
those anticipated in the forward-looking statements could include, among other things, business disruption, operational problems, financial
loss, legal liability and similar risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition,
results of operations, or liquidity. The forward-looking statements included herein are made only as of the date hereof. The Company does
not assume any obligation to publicly provide revisions or updates to any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information,
future developments or otherwise, should circumstances change, except as otherwise required by securities and other applicable laws.
