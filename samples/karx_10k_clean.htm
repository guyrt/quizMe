CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND INFORMATION
This Annual Report on Form 10-K, the other reports, statements, and information that we have previously filed or that we may subsequently file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and public announcements that we have previously made or may subsequently make include, may include, incorporate by reference or may incorporate by reference certain statements that may be deemed to be “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are intended to enjoy the benefits of that act. Unless the context is otherwise, the forward-looking statements included or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K and those reports, statements, information and announcements address activities, events or developments that Karbon-X Corp. (hereinafter referred to as “we,” “us,” “our,” “our Company” or “Karbon-X”) expects or anticipates, will or may occur in the future. Any statements in this document about expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions or future events or performance are not historical facts and are forward-looking statements. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as “may,” “should,” “could,” “predict,” “potential,” “believe,” “will likely result,” “expect,” “will continue,” “anticipate,” “seek,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “projection,” “would” and “outlook,” and similar expressions. Accordingly, these statements involve estimates, assumptions and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in them. Any forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the factors discussed throughout this document. All forward-looking statements concerning economic conditions, rates of growth, rates of income or values as may be included in this document are based on information available to us on the dates noted, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. It is important to note that our actual results may differ materially from those in such forward-looking statements due to fluctuations in interest rates, inflation, government regulations, economic conditions and competitive product and pricing pressures in the geographic and business areas in which we conduct operations, including our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions and other factors discussed elsewhere in this Report.
Certain risk factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations and cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us, and you should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement or statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. The risks and uncertainties we currently face are not the only ones we face. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict which will arise. There may be additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial to our business. In addition, we cannot assess the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.
If any such risks occur, our business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition could be materially affected in an adverse manner. Under such circumstances, you may lose all or part of your investment.
The industry and market data contained in this report are based either on our management's own estimates or, where indicated, independent industry publications, reports by governmental agencies or market research firms or other published independent sources and, in each case, are believed by our management to be reasonable estimates. However, industry and market data is subject to change and cannot always be verified with complete certainty due to limits on the availability and reliability of raw data, the voluntary nature of the data gathering process and other limitations and uncertainties inherent in any statistical survey of market shares. We have not independently verified market and industry data from third-party sources. In addition, consumption patterns and customer preferences can and do change. As a result, you should be aware that market share, ranking and other similar data set forth herein, and estimates and beliefs based on such data, may not be verifiable or reliable.

Item 1. Description of Business
Karbon-X Corp (or "Karbon-X" or "the Company") is a public Nevada corporation that offers investors exposure to certified carbon credits which are a key instrument used by both individuals and corporations to achieve their carbon neutral and net-zero carbon goals. The company is environmental and social governance (ESG) principled and focuses on partnering with high-quality projects and/or companies that generate or are actively involved in the voluntary carbon credit market.
The Company has entered into several letters of intent and intends to invest capital into projects that have proven C02 reduction potential and that may not have been otherwise developed. The majority of these projects have significant social and economic benefits in addition to their carbon reduction or removal potential.
Karbon-X Corp is focused on customized transactional options for corporations to offset their carbon footprint and provides scalable access to the Verified Emissions Reduction markets. Karbon-X is changing the marketing framework of traditional carbon marketing by engaging with the public in order to fund multiple forms of technology based greenhouse gas reduction builds.
Carbon Credit Generation
Karbon-X Corp has begun purchasing verified carbon credits from numerous vendors and then intends to resell these credits to both industry and the general public. The Company has already begun funding projects in order to generate Karbon-X Corp carbon credits of its own. Once verified these projects will generate carbon credits that will be sold on its proprietary APP platform.
Developments
Subsequent to March 31, 2022 and through June 1, 2022, Karbon-X Corp. completed a private placement pursuant to Rule 506(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In that private placement the company sold 3,820,000 units at $0.25 per unit for total gross proceeds of $955,000. Each unit consisted of one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase a share of common stock for $0.75 per share for a period of two years.
In June 2022 the Company made two payments amounting to approximately $232,654 to a third-party app development company.
On April 26, 2022 the company signed a letter of intent with Silversmith Power and Light Company to explore the Silversmith Power and Light hydroelectric systems potential for generating carbon credits. This remains pending.
On May 6, 2022 the Company signed a lease agreement to rent office space for a one-year term beginning June 1, 2022 at a base rent of $1,627.50 per month. This lease was terminated and a new leasehold arrangement was entered into. See “Properties.”
On May 17, 2022 the company signed a letter of intent with Silviculture Systems Corp and 4Ever Forest Foundation of 512-55 Harbour Square Toronto ON to enter into a partnership. The Company entered into a final Acquisition Agreement with Silviculture Systems Corp. and 4Ever Forest Foundation on May 31, 2023. Pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, Karbon-X will purchase 80% of the fully-diluted and outstanding shares of Silviculture for a purchase price of $7,300,000, of which $3,750,000 is was payable in common stock of Karbon-X valued at $0.25 per share upon achievement of certain milestones. The balance of $3,550,000 will be paid out for capital contributions, development and operations of the project over the next 36 months. The project intends to include (i) planting 750,000 Dipteryx Alata (Baru Nut Trees) or other plant varietals so long as they do not diminish the value of the project as per schedule A, (ii) developing the charcoal stream as per schedule A and (iii) creating a system for generating carbon credits,

On May 19, 2022 the Company paid $70,000 to Silviculture Systems Corp to plant 20,000 trees in 2022. By May 31, 2022, the Company had invested $500,000 in the project.
From November 2022 through August 10, 2023, Karbon-X Corp. completed a private placement pursuant to Rule 506(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In that private placement the company sold 4,632,297 shares of common stock for total gross proceeds of $2,316,486.
On June 22, 2023 the company signed a letter of intent with Heimdal Inc from Kailua-Kona, Hawaii to obtain 20% equity interest in all pending and/or future ocean-assisted carbon capture plants of Heimdal. Pursuant to the letter of intent, Karbon-X will acquire that 50% interest for $15,500,000.
Historical Company Information
Karbon-X was incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 31, 2017 under the name Cocoluv, Inc. The articles provided for 200,000,000 authorized shares. At that time Reymund Guillermo was appointed as sole officer and director. On June 9, 2020, the Corporation filed a Certificate of Amendment with the State of Nevada effectuating a 50 for 1 forward stock split. On March 1, 2022, a change of control occurred when Mr. Guillermo resigned as director and all executive officer positions with the Company. Concurrent with Mr. Guillermo’s resignation, Mr. Chad Clovis was appointed as CEO, Director and President, and Ms. Marita Dautel was appointed as Vice President and Director.
On February 21, 2022 Karbon-X Corp, formerly known as Cocoluv, Inc., a Nevada Corporation (“Karbon-X”) entered into a Reorganization and Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Reorganization Agreement”) to acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding equity of Karbon-X Project, Inc., a British Columbia company (“Karbon-X Project”). Effective March 21, 2022, the parties closed the Reorganization Agreement. As part of the transaction, the majority shareholder of Karbon-X delivered 64,897,000 shares of common stock to shareholders of Karbon-X Project and certain other designees.
The Company’s principal office is located at 910 7th Ave SW, Calgary, AB, Canada T2P 3N8. Our telephone number is 844-462-3637. The Company email is info@karbon-x.com.
Competition
Many of our competitors have greater resources that may enable them to compete more effectively than us in the carbon credit industry.
The industry in which we operate is subject to intense and increasing competition. Some of our competitors have a longer operating history and greater capital resources and facilities, which may enable them to compete more effectively in this market. We expect to face additional competition from existing licensees and new market entrants, who are not yet active in the industry. If a significant number of competitors develop, we may experience increased competition for market share and may experience downward pricing pressure on our products as new entrants increase production. Such competition may cause us to encounter difficulties in generating revenues and market share, and in positioning our products in the market. If we are unable to successfully compete with existing companies and new entrants to the market, our lack of competitive advantage will have a negative effect on our business and financial condition.

We have identified many of our key competitors including the following:
Indigo Carbon
As the name most recognized name in the farming community, Indigo Carbon has an impressive list of well known corporate buyers like The North Face, Blue Bottle Coffee, and JP Morgan Chase. While Indigo is touted as a leader in the emerging industry, it may not be the best option for all. Indigo carbon has a proprietary software platform that allows farmers to easily input data from enrolled fields. After enrolling, farmers have access to Indigo’s agronomists and support teams to help implement changes and answer questions. Farmers only get paid for adopting new practices (ie. cover cropping, no-till, reduced N fertilizer, etc.), so if a farmer has been cover cropping for years, they are unlikely to be eligible. Right now they only service specific states (Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, and Texas).
Nori
Nori is a blockchain-enabled company whose sole mission is to be a leading carbon marketplace. Unique to the carbon-removal industry, they are powered by cryptocurrency. Through this pioneering approach, they hope to create efficient and transparent carbon removal transactions. Companies can purchase NORI tokens (whose price depends on the market price of a carbon removal credit at time of purchase). Once it has a NORI token, the company can exchange it for an NRT (or Nori Removal Token). Farmers create NRTs when they sequester 1 ton of CO2. That NRT translates into a NORI token which is priced at market value and can be sold.
TruCarbon by TruTerra
TruTerra is a subsidiary of Land O’Lakes – the world’s largest farmer owned cooperative. The current state of the program is only available to farmers with data from 2016-2020. They have a tool called Truterra Insights Engine that allows farmers to aggregate data from the past five years in a format best suited to enroll in a carbon program. Enrollment is contingent upon committing to a 20 year reporting period using the Truterra Insights Engine (carbon reporting contracts are similar to conservation easements, meaning that they can be transferred in the case of transfer of property).
Bayer Carbon Initiative
Bayer’s recently announced Carbon Initiative is still in its beginning phases with very little public detail. That said, they (like many of the other carbon credit companies on this list), will only pay farmers for adopting new cover crop or no-till/strip till practices. Bayer is a hugely influential food and agriculture company in its own right, so they have the resources and expertise to roll out a strong program after this pilot season.
Nutrien Ag
Nutrien’s core businesses are creating seeds, fertilizers, herbicides, and software to optimize farm performance. In November 2020 they announced their involvement in the carbon marketplace. Nutrien has a deep bench of agronomists on staff to provide guidance for newly enrolled farmers, so entering the market may have additional benefits for farmers looking for guidance on how best to sequester carbon. As a global retailer they have plenty of connections to influential companies who might be interested in purchasing carbon credits once the program is officially launched.

Carbon Streaming Corp
Under stream agreements, Carbon Streaming Corp. makes upfront and ongoing delivery payments to project developers for future carbon credits. This financing structure creates carbon credit projects that reduce emissions in a sustainable manner. Our streams and investments then provide us with a diversified portfolio of carbon credits with exposure to potential rising carbon prices.
Base Carbon
Base Carbon partners with corporations, sovereign entities, academic institutions and carbon reduction project developers to produce and commercialize verified carbon credits. Base Carbon differentiates itself through sourcing and underwriting and financing the maturation of nature and technology based carbon reduction credit projects. Base Carbon seeks to simplify the carbon credit economy and become a financier within the voluntary carbon markets.
Climeworks
Climeworks develops, builds and operates direct air capture machines. Climeworks captures carbon dioxide directly from the air; removing CO₂ emissions. The air-captured carbon dioxide can either be recycled and used as a raw material, or completely removed from the air by safely storing it. Climework’s machines consist of modular CO₂ collectors that can be stacked to build machines of any size.
Sales
The Company’s two main revenue streams include industrial sales and subscription-based sales through a mobile APP.
Industrial Sales
Karbon-X Corp primarily operates in the voluntary carbon offset market. The Company sells carbon offsets to mining, forestry, civic earthworks, transportation and oil and gas servicing companies based on their total fossil fuel consumption for individual projects. This simple platform offers companies a way to reach their carbon neutrality goals while supporting C02 reducing projects for years to come.
When companies purchase carbon offsets from Karbon-X Corp directly to offset their fossil fuel consumption the credits are retired in the name of the customer which provides transparency.
Subscription Based Sales
The general public is be able purchase carbon offsets from a mobile APP that is subscription based, with multiple levels of investment for every budget. Each subscription will support C02 reducing projects such as direct air capture, green hydroelectric energy production, or reforestation and will reduce greenhouse gas emissions with provable, verifiable carbon credits. The APP was soft-launched in early 2023 and is undergoing user experience testing in select markets prior to global launch.

Risks Related to Our Operations
We will incur losses and there is no guarantee that we will ever become profitable.
We are a relatively newly formed company. There is no guarantee that we will ever become profitable. The costs for research, product development, along with marketing and selling expenses, and the general and administrative expenses, will be principal causes of our costs and/or potential losses. We may never become profitable and if we do not become profitable your investment could be harmed or lost completely.
We may need additional capital in the future in order to continue our operations.
We obtained approximately $3,271,486 in our recent private placements which we are using for development and operations. However, if in the future we do not turn profitable or generate cash from operations and additional capital is needed to support operations, economic and market conditions may make it difficult or impossible to raise additional funds through debt or equity financings. If funds are not sufficient to support operations, we may need to pursue a financing or reduce expenditures to meet our cash requirements. If we do obtain such financing, we cannot assure that the amount or the terms of such financing will be as attractive as we may desire, and your equity interest in the company may be diluted considerably. If we are unable to obtain such financing when needed, or if the amount of such financing is not sufficient, it may be necessary for us to take significant cost saving measures or generate funding in ways that may negatively affect our business in the future. To reduce expenses, we may be forced to make personnel reductions or curtail or discontinue development programs. To generate funds, it may be necessary to monetize future royalty streams, sell intellectual property, divest of technology platforms or liquidate assets. However, there is no assurance that, if required, we will be able to generate sufficient funds or reduce spending to provide the required liquidity. Long-term capital requirements will depend on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the status of collaborative arrangements, the progress of research and development programs and the receipt of revenues from sales of products. Our ability to achieve and/or sustain profitable operations depends on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control.
We have entered into Agreements which will require substantial additional capital.
We have entered into an agreement with Silviculture Systems which will require an additional $2,850,000 to fund operations over the next 36 months. We are working with potential financing sources to fund this acquisition, however there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain the required funding.
We launched our products in 2023 and as a company, we have limited sales and marketing experience.
We launched our APP in early 2023, and although we have hired highly qualified personnel with specialized expertise, as a company, we have limited experience commercializing products on our own. In order to commercialize the app and our carbon credits business, we have to build our sales, marketing, distribution, managerial and other non-technical capabilities and make arrangements with third parties to perform these services when needed. We may have to hire sales representatives and district managers to fill sales territories. To the extent we are relying on third parties to commercialize our business, we may receive less revenues or incur more expenses than if we had commercialized the products ourselves. In addition, we may have limited control over the sales efforts of any third parties involved in our commercialization efforts. If we are unable to successfully implement our commercial plans and drive adoption by patients and physicians of our products through our sales, marketing and commercialization efforts, or if our partners fail to successfully commercialize our products, then we may not be able to generate sustainable revenues from product sales which will have a material adverse effect on our business and future product opportunities. Similarly, we may not be successful in establishing the necessary commercial infrastructure, including sales representatives, wholesale distributors, legal and regulatory affairs teams. The establishment and development of commercialization capabilities to market our products has been and will continue to be expensive and time-consuming. As we continue to develop these capabilities, we will have to compete with other companies to recruit, hire, train and retain sales and marketing personnel. If we have underestimated the necessary sales and marketing capabilities or have not established the necessary infrastructure to support successful commercialization, or if our efforts to do so take more time and expense than anticipated, our ability to market and sell our products may be adversely affected.

Commercialization of our products will require significant resources, and if we do not achieve the sales expected, we may lose the substantial investment made in our products.
We are continuing to make substantial expenditures commercializing our products. We are devoting substantial resources to building our research and development. We have and expect to continue to devote substantial resources to establish and maintain a marketing capability for our products. If we are unsuccessful in our commercialization efforts and do not achieve the sales levels of our products that we expect, we may be unable to recover the large investment we have made in research, development, and marketing efforts, and our business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
We will rely on third parties to perform many necessary services for our products, including services related to the distribution and invoicing.
We intend to and have begun to retain and partner with third-party service providers to perform a variety of functions related to the sale and distribution of our products, key aspects of which are out of our direct control. If these third-party service providers fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, fail to meet expected deadlines, or otherwise do not carry out their contractual duties to us, or encounter physical damage or natural disaster at their facilities, our ability to deliver product to meet commercial demand would be significantly impaired. In addition, we may utilize third parties to perform various other services for us relating to sample accountability and regulatory monitoring, including adverse event reporting, safety database management and other product maintenance services. If the quality or accuracy of the data maintained by these service providers is insufficient, our ability to continue to market our products could be jeopardized or we could be subject to regulatory sanctions. We do not currently have the internal capacity to perform these important commercial functions, and we may not be able to maintain commercial arrangements for these services on reasonable terms.
The failure of any of our third-party distributors to market, distribute and sell our products as planned may result in us not meeting revenue and profit targets.
If one or more of these distributors fail to pursue the development or marketing of the products as planned, our revenues and profits may not reach expectations or may decline. The success of the marketing organizations of our partners, as well as the level of priority assigned to the marketing of the products by these entities, which may differ from our priorities, may determine the success of the product sales. Competition in this market could also force us to reduce the prices of our products below currently planned levels, which could adversely affect our revenues and future profitability.

If we cannot develop and market our products as rapidly or cost-effectively as our competitors, we may never be able to achieve profitable operations.
Our success depends, in part, upon maintaining a competitive position in the development of products. If we cannot maintain competitive products and technologies, our current and potential distribution partners may choose to adopt the products of our competitors. Our competitors may develop products that are more effective or are less costly than our products.
Some of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, and marketing and distribution than we do.
Others may bring infringement claims against us, which could be time-consuming and expensive to defend.
Third parties may claim that the use or sale of our technologies infringe their patent rights. As with any litigation where claims may be asserted, we may have to seek licenses, defend infringement actions or challenge the validity of those patents in the patent office or the courts. If these are not resolved favorably, we may not be able to continue to develop and commercialize our product candidates. Even if we were able to obtain rights to a third party’s intellectual property, these rights may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors potential access to the same intellectual property. If we are found liable for infringement or are not able to have these patents declared invalid or unenforceable, we may be liable for significant monetary damages, encounter significant delays in bringing products to market or be precluded from participating in the development, use or sale of products covered by patents of others. Any litigation could be costly and time-consuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. We may not have identified, or be able to identify in the future, U.S. or foreign patents that pose a risk of potential infringement claims. Ultimately, we may be unable to commercialize some of our product candidates as a result of patent infringement claims, which could potentially harm our business.
Our business could be harmed if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements and, as a result, are subject to sanctions.
If we, or companies with whom we are developing technologies or products on our behalf, fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the companies, and we, may be subject to sanctions, including the following:

Risks Related to our Common Stock
Our common stock is currently trading on the “Expert” market.
Because of delays in filing a Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q during 2022, our stock has been moved to the “expert” market by OTC Markets. As such, it can only be traded between brokers and no quote is published. In order to resolve this situation, we are working to file a new Information Statement on Form 15c2-11 through either OTC Markets or a broker dealer with FINRA which, upon clearing, would move the stock back to the OTC Pink, and ultimately OTCQB markets on OTC Markets. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in returning to those markets.
Future conversions or exercises by holders of options could dilute our common stock.
Purchasers of our common stock will experience dilution of their investment upon exercise of the employee stock option and other stock options or issued common shares.
Sales of our common stock by our officers and directors may lower the market price of our common stock.
Our officers and directors beneficially own a significant aggregate of shares of our outstanding common stock. If our officers and directors, or other significant stockholders, sell a substantial amount of our common stock, it could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease.
We do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.
We intend to retain any earnings in the foreseeable future for our continued growth and, thus, do not expect to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
Anti-takeover effects of certain certificate of incorporation and bylaw provisions could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control.
Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could discourage, delay or prevent persons from acquiring or attempting to acquire us. Our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors, without action of our stockholders, to designate and issue preferred stock in one or more series, with such rights, preferences and privileges as the board of directors shall determine. In addition, our bylaws grant our board of directors the authority to adopt, amend or repeal all or any of our bylaws, subject to the power of the stockholders to change or repeal the bylaws. In addition, our bylaws limit who may call meetings of our stockholders.
Dependence upon Management and Key Personnel
The Company is, and will be, heavily dependent on the skill, acumen and services of the management of the Company. The loss of the services of this individuals or any other key individuals, including specifically Chad Clovis, and certain others, for any substantial length of time would materially and adversely affect the Company’s results of operation and financial position. (See “Management”).

Item 2. Properties.
On May 6, 2023 the Company entered into a 40-month Commercial Lease Agreement with 459061 Ltd. to lease office space at 910 7
th
Ave SW, Calgary, AB, Canada, T2P 3N8.
The Company leases office space from a third party under an operating lease agreement over 40 months which expires in July 2026. The lease also includes the payment of executory costs.
Lease right-of-use assets represent the right to use an underlying asset pursuant to the lease for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement of an arrangement where it is determined at inception that a lease exists. These assets and liabilities are initially recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term calculated using our estimated incremental borrowing rate generally applicable to the location of the lease right-of-use asset, unless an implicit rate is readily determinable. We combine lease and certain non-lease components in determining the lease payments subject to the initial present value calculation. Lease right-of-use assets include upfront lease payments and exclude lease incentives, if applicable. When lease terms include an option to extend the lease, we have not assumed the options will be exercised.
Lease expense for operating leases generally consist of both fixed and variable components. Expense related to fixed lease payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Variable lease payments are generally expensed as incurred, where applicable, and include agreed-upon changes in rent, certain non-lease components, such as maintenance and other services provided by the lessor, and other charges included in the lease. Leases with an initial term of twelve months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. We recognized total lease expense of approximately $15,992 and $305 for the years ended May 31, 2023 and 2022, primarily related to operating lease costs paid to lessors from operating cash flows. We entered into our operating lease in April 2023 with a term of three years.
Item 3. Legal Proceedings.
We are not aware of any legal proceedings contemplated by any governmental authority or any other party involving us or our properties.
As of the date of this report, no director, officer or affiliate is (i) a party adverse to us in any legal proceeding, or (ii) has an adverse interest to us in any legal proceedings. We are not aware of any other legal proceedings pending or that have been threatened against us or our properties.
From time to time the Company may be named in claims arising in the ordinary course of business. Currently, no legal proceedings or claims, other than those disclosed above, are pending against or involve the Company that, in the opinion of management, could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on its business and financial condition.

Market Information
Our common stock is traded in United States markets by OTC Markets Group, Inc., a privately owned company headquartered in New York City, under the symbol “KARX.” The common stock currently trades on the OTC Markets “expert” market.

There is no assurance that the common stock will continue to be traded on the OTC Markets or that any liquidity exists for our shareholders.
Market Price
As the reorganization closed on March 21, 2022 and does not reflect the current operations of the Company, historical market price information before that date is not material to the operations of the Company. Historical market price information is currently not available to the Company as it is traded on the OTC “expert” market while we work to return to the OTC Pink and subsequently OTCQB Markets.

As a result of the Reorganization Agreement and the change in business and operations of the Company, a discussion of the financial results of the Company, formally known as Cocoluv, Inc., prior to February 21, 2022 is not pertinent, and, under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States the historical financial results of Karbon-X Project, Inc., the acquirer for accounting purposes, prior to the Reorganization Agreement are considered the historical financial results of the Company.
The following discussion highlights the Company’s results of operations and the principal factors that have affected its consolidated financial condition as well as its liquidity and capital resources for the periods described, and provides information that management believes is relevant for an assessment and understanding of the Company’s consolidated financial condition and results of operations presented herein. The following discussion and analysis are based Karbon-X Corp’s audited and unaudited financial statements contained in this Current Report, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. You should read the discussion and analysis together with such financial statements and the related notes thereto.
Overview
Karbon-X Corp. was incorporated in the State of Nevada under the name Cocoluv, Inc. on September 13, 2017 and established a fiscal year end of May 31. On April 7, 2022 the Company changed its name to Karbon-X Corp.
On February 21, 2022, pursuant to the terms of a Share Exchange Agreement, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Karbon-X Project Inc. ("Karbon-X"), and Karbon-X became the wholly owned subsidiary of the Company in a reverse merger (the "Reverse Acquisition"). Pursuant to the Reverse Acquisition, all of the issued and outstanding shares of Karbon-X common stock were converted, at an exchange ratio of 20,000-for-1, into an aggregate of 20,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock, resulting in Karbon-X becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and all debt owed to the related party of Cocoluv, Inc. was forgiven. The accompanying financial statements' share information has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the exchange ratio in the Reverse Acquisition.
Karbon-X provides customized transactional options, tailored insights, and scalable access to the Verified Emissions Reduction markets.
Karbon-X changes the marketing framework of traditional carbon marketing by engaging the public vs industry with multiple forms of technology based greenhouse gas reduction builds. Karbon-X will allow the public to purchase carbon offsets from an APP that is subscription based, with multiple levels of investment for every budget. Each subscription will support clean energy projects such as solar or wind power, methane capture, or reforestation and will reduce greenhouse gas emissions with provable, verifiable carbon credits.
Effects of COVID-19
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. This contagious disease outbreak and the related adverse public health developments have adversely affected workforces, economies, and financial markets globally, leading to an economic downturn. Management has determined that there has been no significant impact to the Company’s operations, however management continues to monitor the situation.

Critical Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
Karbon-X Corp. was incorporated in the State of Nevada under the name CocoLuv, Inc. on September 13, 2017 and established a fiscal year end of May 31.
On February 21, 2022, pursuant to the terms of a Share Exchange Agreement, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Karbon-X Project Inc. ("Karbon-X"), and Karbon-X became the wholly owned subsidiary of the Company in a reverse merger (the "Reverse Acquisition"). Pursuant to the Reverse Acquisition, all of the issued and outstanding shares of Karbon-X common stock were converted, at an exchange ratio of 20,000-for-1, into an aggregate of 20,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock, resulting in Karbon-X becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and all debt owed to the related party of Cocoluv, Inc. was forgiven. Karbon-X Project Inc. was incorporated in British Columbia on February 11, 2022 and established a fiscal year end of May 31. The accompanying financial statements' share information has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the exchange ratio in the Reverse Acquisition. As part of the Reverse Acquisition, on April 14, 2022 the Company changed its name to Karbon-X Corp.
Under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("US GAAP"), because the combined entity will be dependent on Karbon-X's senior management, the Reverse Acquisition was accounted for as a recapitalization effected by a share exchange, wherein Karbon-X is considered the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes. On the date of the reorganization, the assets and liabilities of Karbon-X have been brought forward at their book value and consolidated with Cocoluv, Inc.’s assets, which comprised of cash and cash equivalents of $134 and liabilities which comprises due to related party of $99,902 No goodwill has been recognized. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities and the historical operations that are reflected in the consolidated financial statements are those of Karbon-X and are recorded at the historical cost basis of Karbon-X.
Going concern
To date the Company has generated minimal revenues from its business operations and has incurred operating losses since inception of $2,192,106. The Company will require additional funding to meet its ongoing obligations and to fund anticipated operating losses. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on raising capital to fund its initial business plan and ultimately to attain profitable operations. Accordingly, these factors raise substantial doubt as to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company intends to continue to fund its business by way of private placements and advances from related parties as may be required. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty.
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
The consolidated financial statements present the consolidated balance sheet, statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and cash flows of the Company. These consolidated financial statements are presented in the United States dollar and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

Use of Estimates and Assumptions
Preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers highly liquid financial instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Sales Tax Receivable
Sales tax receivable consists of the accumulated reclaimable GST paid by the Company on purchases made in Canada.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets which are between three to seven years.
Costs of major additions and improvements are capitalized while expenditures for maintenance and repairs, which do not extend the life of the asset, are expensed. Upon sale or disposition of property and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are eliminated from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is credited or charged to income. Long-lived assets held and used by us are reviewed based on market factors and operational considerations for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
Inventory
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, using weighted average of the cost of the goods on hand at the year end or net realizable value.
Investments
The Company accounts for investments with a 20% to 50% ownership and a significant, but not controlling influence as equity method investments. Investments with a greater than 50% ownership and a controlling influence are accounted for using the consolidation method. The Company assesses the potential impairment of equity method investments when indicators such as a history of operating losses, negative earnings and cash flow outlook, and the financial condition and prospects for the investee’s business segment might indicate a loss in value.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying amount of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities approximate their fair values due to their short-term maturities.

Foreign Currency Translation
The functional currency of the Company is the Canadian Dollar (“CAD”). For financial statement purposes, the reporting currency is the United States Dollar (“USD”).
For financial reporting purposes, the consolidated financial statements are translated into the Company’s reporting currency, USD. Asset and liabilities are translated using the closing exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date with the resulting translation adjustments included as a separate component of shareholder’s equity through other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated statement of operations.
Income and expenses are translated at the average yearly rates of exchange. The Company includes realized gains and losses from foreign currency transactions in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations.
Warrants
There is estimation uncertainty with respect to selecting inputs to the Black-Sholes model used to determine the fair value of the warrants.
The above estimates and assumptions are reviewed regularly. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
Earnings per Common Share
The basic loss per share is calculated by dividing the Company’s net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares during the year. The diluted loss per share is calculated by dividing the Company’s net loss available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. As of May 31, 2023, potential dilutive securities had an anti-dilutive effect and were not included in the calculation of diluted net loss per share.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
The consolidated financial statements present the consolidated balance sheet, statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and cash flows of the Company. These consolidated financial statements are presented in the United States dollar and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
Reverse Acquisition
On February 21, 2022, pursuant to the terms of a Share Exchange Agreement, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Karbon-X Project Inc. ("Karbon-X"), and Karbon-X became the wholly owned subsidiary of the Company in a reverse merger (the "Reverse Acquisition"). Pursuant to the Reverse Acquisition, all of the issued and outstanding shares of Karbon-X common stock were converted, at an exchange ratio of 20,000-for-1, into an aggregate of 20,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock, resulting in Karbon-X becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and all debt owed to the related party of Cocoluv, Inc. was forgiven. The accompanying financial statements' share information has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the exchange ratio in the Reverse Acquisition.

As of May 31, 2023, the Company had $312,173 in current assets.
To date, the Company has financed its operations through equity sales.
On March 7, 2022 the Company commenced a private placement pursuant to Rule 506(c) promulgated under Regulation D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The private placement is ongoing. The private placement sought to raise $1,000,000 through the sale of Units at $0.25 per Unit, each consisting of one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of common stock for two years at an exercise price of $0.50 per share. As of September 1, 2022 we have obtained $955,000 in gross proceeds from this offering.
From November 2022 through August 10, 2023, Karbon-X Corp. completed a private placement pursuant to Rule 506(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In that private placement the company sold 4,632,297 shares of common stock for total gross proceeds of $2,316,486.
Future Financing
In connection with its proposed business plan and possible acquisitions, in addition to the possible proceeds from this offering the Company will be required to complete substantial and significant additional capital formation. Such formation could be through additional equity offerings, debt, bank financings or a combination of any source of financing. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in completion of such financings.
Plan of Operations
As noted above, the continuation of our current plan of operations requires us to raise significant additional capital. If we are successful in raising capital through the sale of common shares, we believe that we will have sufficient cash resources to fund our plan of operations through 2023. If we are unable to do so, we may have to curtail and possibly cease some operations. We intend to use the net proceeds from the offering for research and development, operations, regulatory compliance, intellectual property, working capital and general corporate purposes.
We continually evaluate our plan of operations to determine the manner in which we can most effectively utilize our limited cash resources. The timing of completion of any aspect of our plan of operations is highly dependent upon the availability of cash to implement that aspect of the plan and other factors beyond our control. There is no assurance that we will successfully obtain the required capital or revenues, or, if obtained, that the amounts will be sufficient to fund our ongoing operations.

Capital Expenditures
As of May 31, 2023 we had capital expenditures of $750,575.
Commitments and Contractual Obligations
As a “smaller reporting company” as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide this information.
Off-balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements.
Going Concern
To date the Company has generated $9,833 in revenues from its business operations and has incurred operating losses since inception of $2,192,106. As of May 31, 2023, the Company has working capital of $117,692. The Company will require additional funding to meet its ongoing obligations and to fund anticipated operating losses. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on raising capital to fund its initial business plan and ultimately to attain profitable operations. Accordingly, these factors raise substantial doubt as to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company intends to continue to fund its business by way of private placements and advances from related parties as may be required. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty.
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Karbon-X Corp.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Karbon-X Corp. (“the Company”) as of May 31, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of May 31, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Going Concern
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has generated minimal revenues from its business operations and has incurred operating losses since inception. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Valuation of Investments — Refer to Notes 1 and 7 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company holds an investment that is accounted for as an equity investment without a readily determinable fair value and is adjusted each reporting period to record their share of the earnings or losses of the investee. The valuation of the investment is based on significant judgment regarding appropriate valuation and is highly subjective; therefore, we assessed this as a critical audit matter.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to evaluating the Company’s accounting for investments and related accounts included the following, among others:

KARBON-X CORP.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
May 31, 2023
Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies
Karbon-X Corp. was incorporated in the State of Nevada under the name CocoLuv, Inc. on September 13, 2017 and established a fiscal year end of May 31.
On February 21, 2022, pursuant to the terms of a Share Exchange Agreement, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Karbon-X Project Inc. ("Karbon-X"), and Karbon-X became the wholly owned subsidiary of the Company in a reverse merger (the "Reverse Acquisition"). Pursuant to the Reverse Acquisition, all of the issued and outstanding shares of Karbon-X common stock were converted, at an exchange ratio of
20,000-for-1
, into an aggregate of
20,000,000
shares of the Company's common stock, resulting in Karbon-X becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and all debt owed to the related party of Cocoluv, Inc. was forgiven. Karbon-X Project Inc. was incorporated in British Columbia on February 11, 2022 and established a fiscal year end of May 31. The accompanying financial statements' share information has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the exchange ratio in the Reverse Acquisition. As part of the Reverse Acquisition, on April 14, 2022 the Company changed its name to Karbon-X Corp.
Under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("US GAAP"), because the combined entity will be dependent on Karbon-X's senior management, the Reverse Acquisition was accounted for as a recapitalization effected by a share exchange, wherein Karbon-X is considered the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes. On the date of the reorganization, the assets and liabilities of Karbon-X have been brought forward at their book value and consolidated with Cocoluv, Inc.’s assets, which comprised of cash and cash equivalents of $
134
and liabilities which comprises due to related party of $
99,902
(see Note 1 Basis of Presentation below). No goodwill has been recognized. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities and the historical operations that are reflected in the consolidated financial statements are those of Karbon-X and are recorded at the historical cost basis of Karbon-X.
Going concern
To date the Company has generated minimal revenues from its business operations and has incurred operating losses since inception of $
2,192,106
.  The Company will require additional funding to meet its ongoing obligations and to fund anticipated operating losses.  The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on raising capital to fund its initial business plan and ultimately to attain profitable operations.  Accordingly, these factors raise substantial doubt as to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.  The Company intends to continue to fund its business by way of private placements and advances from related parties as may be required. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty.
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
The consolidated financial statements present the consolidated balance sheet, statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and cash flows of the Company. These consolidated financial statements are presented in the United States dollar and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
Use of Estimates and Assumptions
Preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers highly liquid financial instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Sales Tax Receivable
Sales tax receivable consists of the accumulated reclaimable GST paid by the Company on purchases made in Canada.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets which are between three to seven years.
###table###
<table><tbody><tr><td> </td></tr><tr><td>F-7</td></tr><tr><td><p/></td></tr><tr><td><em><a>Table of Contents</a></em></td></tr></tbody></table>
###endtable###
Costs of major additions and improvements are capitalized while expenditures for maintenance and repairs, which do not extend the life of the asset, are expensed. Upon sale or disposition of property and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are eliminated from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is credited or charged to income. Long-lived assets held and used by us are reviewed based on market factors and operational considerations for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
Inventory
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, using weighted average of the cost of the goods on hand at the year end or net realizable value.
Investments
The Company accounts for investments with a 20% to 50% ownership and a significant, but not controlling influence as equity method investments. Investments with a greater than 50% ownership and a controlling influence are accounted for using the consolidation method. The Company assesses the potential impairment of equity method investments when indicators such as a history of operating losses, negative earnings and cash flow outlook, and the financial condition and prospects for the investee’s business segment might indicate a loss in value. The Company has accounted for its investment in Silviculture Systems using the equity method and its investment in its subsidiary Karbon-X Project, Inc using the consolidation method.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company uses a three-tier fair value hierarchy to classify and disclose all assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, as well as assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, in periods subsequent to their initial measurement. The hierarchy requires the Company to use observable inputs when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs, when determining fair value. The three tiers are defined as follows:
###table###
<table><tbody><tr><td><p> </p></td><td><p>●</p></td><td><p>Level 1—Observable inputs that reflect quoted market prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets;</p></td></tr><tr><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> </p></td><td><p>●</p></td><td><p>Level 2—Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly in the marketplace for identical or similar assets and liabilities; and</p></td></tr><tr><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> </p></td><td><p>●</p></td><td><p>Level 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market data, which require the Company to develop its own assumptions.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
###endtable###
The carrying amount of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities approximate their fair values due to their short-term maturities.
Revenue Recognition
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Since ASU 2014-09 was issued, several additional ASUs have been issued to clarify various elements of the guidance. These standards provide guidance on recognizing revenue, including a five-step model to determine when revenue recognition is appropriate. The standard requires that an entity recognize revenue to depict the transfer of control of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Under ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue from the commercial sales of carbon credits and consulting services by applying the following steps: (1) identify the contract with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied.
Rates for consulting services are typically per day, per hour, or a similar basis. Consulting revenue is recognized over the period in which the service is provided.
Revenue for sales of carbon credits is recognized at a point in time when control of the credit transfers to the buyer. The Company act as a principal in all revenue transactions.
Foreign Currency Translation
The functional currency of the Company is the Canadian Dollar (“CAD”). For financial statement purposes, the reporting currency is the United States Dollar (“USD”).
For financial reporting purposes, the consolidated financial statements are translated into the Company’s reporting currency, USD. Asset and liabilities are translated using the closing exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date with the resulting translation adjustments included as a separate component of shareholder’s equity through other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated statement of operations.
Income and expenses are translated at the average yearly rates of exchange. The Company includes realized gains and losses from foreign currency transactions in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations.
Warrants
There is estimation uncertainty with respect to selecting inputs to the Black-Sholes model used to determine the fair value of the warrants (Note 6).  These inputs include the stock price of $0.25, exercise price of $0.75, time to maturity of two years, annual risk-free interest rate ranging from 2.66% - 3.15%, and annualized volatility ranging from 636.15% - 637.12%.
The above estimates and assumptions are reviewed regularly. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
Significant Estimates
Significant estimates applied in the preparation of these financial statements include the estimated useful lives of property and equipment, share volatility and estimated life of options and warrants in determining their fair value as well as the expected potential for the realization of deferred tax assets in determining the amount of the valuation allowance thereto.
Earnings per Common Share
The basic loss per share is calculated by dividing the Company’s net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares during the year. The diluted loss per share is calculated by dividing the Company’s net loss available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. As of May 31, 2023, potential dilutive securities had an anti-dilutive effect and were not included in the calculation of diluted net loss per share.
Reclassifications
Certain amounts in the consolidated financial statements for the prior year have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on net earnings, financial position, or cash flows.
Note 2 – Prepaid Expenses
As of May 31, 2023 and May 31, 2022, prepaid expenses consisted of the following:

###endtable###
Lease right-of-use assets represent the right to use an underlying asset pursuant to the lease for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement of an arrangement where it is determined at inception that a lease exists. These assets and liabilities are initially recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term calculated using our estimated incremental borrowing rate generally applicable to the location of the lease right-of-use asset, unless an implicit rate is readily determinable. We combine lease and certain non-lease components in determining the lease payments subject to the initial present value calculation. Lease right-of-use assets include upfront lease payments and exclude lease incentives, if applicable. When lease terms include an option to extend the lease, we have not assumed the options will be exercised.
Lease expense for operating leases generally consist of both fixed and variable components. Expense related to fixed lease payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Variable lease payments are generally expensed as incurred, where applicable, and include agreed-upon changes in rent, certain non-lease components, such as maintenance and other services provided by the lessor, and other charges included in the lease. Leases with an initial term of twelve months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. We recognized total lease expense of approximately $
15,992
and $
305
for the years ended May 31, 2023 and 2022, primarily related to operating lease costs paid to lessors from operating cash flows. We entered into our operating lease in April 2023 with a term of three years.
Future minimum lease payments under operating leases that have initial noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year at May 31, 2023 were as follows:

Item 9. Change in and Disagreement with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure
For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022, we engaged Michael Gillespie & Associates, PLLC (“Gillespie”) who audited our consolidated financial statements from inception through May 31, 2022. Neither PLS’ nor Gillespie’s report on our consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity (deficit) and cash flows for the years then ended, contained an adverse opinion, and was not modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles.
During those fiscal years and further through August 26, 2022, there have been no disagreement with Gillespie on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreement, if not resolved to the satisfaction of PLS or Gillespie, as the case may be, would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement(s) in connection with its report.
On November 29, 2022 we notified Michael Gillespie & Associates, PLLC (“Gillespie”) that it was terminated as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm. The decision to terminate Gillespie as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm was approved by the Company’s Board of Directors on November 28, 2022.
During the years ended May 31, 2021 and May 31, 2022 and through November 29, 2022, the Company has not had any disagreements with Gillespie on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to Gillespie’s satisfaction, would have caused them to make reference thereto in their reports on the Company’s financial statements for such periods. During our recent fiscal year ended May 31, 2022, Gillespie did not advise us on any matter set forth in Item 304(a)(1)(v)(A) through (D) of Regulation S-K.
During our recent fiscal year ended May 31, 2022 we did not consult with Gillespie regarding (i) the application of accounting principles to a specific transaction, either completed or contemplated, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on our financial statements, and no written report or oral advice was provided to us that was an important factor to be considered by us in reaching a decision as to an accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement (as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K) or a reportable event (as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K).
The report of Gillespie regarding the Company's consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022 did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles.
Effective November 29, 2022 the Company engaged Fruci & Associates II, PLLC (“Fruci”) as its independent registered public accounting firm for the Company’s fiscal year ended May 31, 2023. The decision to engage Fruci as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm was approved by the Company’s Board of Directors.
During the two most recent fiscal years and through the Engagement Date, the Company has not consulted with Fruci regarding either: (i) the application of accounting principles to any specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company’s financial statements, and neither a written report was provided to the Company nor oral advice was provided that Fruci concluded was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to the accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement (as defined in paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of Item 304 of Regulation S-K and the related instructions thereto) or a reportable event (as described in paragraph (a)(1)(v) of Item 304 of Regulation S-K).

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.
Our management evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2023. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in 2013 Internal Control — Integrated Framework. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that, as of May 31, 2023, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective.
This annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permits us to provide only management’s report in this annual report.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
.
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Item 9B. Other Information
None.
