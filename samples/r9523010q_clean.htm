Notes to Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements

<td/><td><b>1.</b></td><td><b>DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS</b></td></tr></table>
###endtable###
Organization
Alzamend Neuro, Inc. (the
“Company” or “Alzamend”), is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel products for
the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (“Alzheimer’s”), bipolar disorder (“BD”), major depressive disorder
(“MDD”) and post-traumatic stress disorder (“PTSD”). With two current product candidates, Alzamend aims to bring
treatments or cures to market at a reasonable cost as quickly as possible. The Company’s current pipeline consists of two novel
therapeutic drug candidates: (i) a patented ionic cocrystal technology delivering a therapeutic combination of lithium, proline and salicylate,
known as AL001, through two royalty-bearing exclusive worldwide licenses from the University of South Florida Research Foundation, Inc.,
as licensor (the “Licensor”); and (ii) a patented method using a mutant peptide sensitized cell as a cell-based therapeutic
vaccine that seeks to restore the ability of a patient’s immunological system to combat Alzheimer’s, known as ALZN002, through
a royalty-bearing exclusive worldwide license from the same Licensor.
The Company is devoting substantially
all its efforts towards research and development of its two product candidates and raising capital. The Company has not generated any
product revenue to date. The Company has financed its operations to date primarily through debt financings and through the sale of its
common stock, par value $
0.0001
per share (“Common Stock”). The Company expects to continue to incur net losses in the foreseeable
future.
###table###
<table><tr>
<td/><td><b>2.</b></td><td><b>LIQUIDITY AND GOING CONCERN</b></td></tr></table>
###endtable###
The accompanying financial
statements have been prepared on the basis that the Company will continue as a going concern. As of July 31, 2023, the Company had cash
of $
1.7
million, an accumulated deficit of $
47.6
million and stockholders’ deficit of $
113,000
. For the three months ended July
31, 2023, the Company had a net loss of $
3.5
million and cash used in operating activities of $
3.3
million. Historically, the Company
has financed its operations principally through issuances of equity and debt instruments.
The
Company believes its current cash on hand is not sufficient to fund its planned operations through one year after the date the financial
statements are issued. These factors create substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for at
least one year after the date that these condensed financial statements are issued.
The Company’s inability to
continue as a going concern could have a negative impact on the company, including our ability to obtain
needed financing. The Company’s financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification
of recorded assets, or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should it be unable to continue as a going
concern.
In order to continue as a
going concern, the Company will need to raise additional funds. The Company plans to seek additional funding through public equity, private
equity and debt financings. Additional funds may also be received from the exercise of warrants (Note 7) and the receipt of funds from
the note receivable (Note 4). The terms of any additional financing may adversely affect the holdings or rights of the Company’s
stockholders. If the Company is unable to obtain funding, it could be required to delay, reduce or eliminate research and development
programs and planned clinical trials which could adversely affect the Company’s business operations.

Basis of Presentation
The accompanying condensed
financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) applicable to interim
reports of companies filing as a smaller reporting company. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited
financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company’s Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2023, filed with
the SEC on July 27, 2023. In the opinion of management, the accompanying condensed interim financial statements include all adjustments
necessary in order to make the financial statements not misleading. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily
indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or any other future period. Certain notes to the financial statements that
would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in the audited financial statements for the most recent fiscal year as reported
in the Company’s Report on Form 10-K have been omitted. The accompanying condensed balance sheet at April 30, 2023 has been derived
from the audited balance sheet at April 30, 2023 contained in such Form 10-K.

Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial
statements, in conformity with U.S. GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
expenses during the reporting period. The Company’s significant accounting policies that involve significant judgment and estimates
include stock-based compensation, warrant valuation, and valuation of deferred income taxes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all
highly liquid investments with a remaining maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. As of July 31, 2023
and April 30, 2023, the Company had
no
cash equivalents.
Fair Value of Financial
Instruments
Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 820,
Fair Value Measurement
, defines fair value
as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous
market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques
used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The fair value hierarchy
is based on three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value, of which the first two are considered observable and the last
is considered unobservable:
Level 1: Quoted prices in
active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Inputs other than
Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in
markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the
full term of the assets or liabilities.
Level 3 assumptions: Unobservable
inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities including
liabilities resulting from imbedded derivatives associated with certain warrants to purchase Common Stock.
The fair values of warrants are determined
using the Black-Scholes valuation model, a “Level 3” fair value measurement, based on the estimated fair value of Common Stock,
volatility based on the historical volatility data of similar companies, considering the industry, products and market capitalization
of such other entities, the expected life based on the remaining contractual term of the warrants and the risk free interest rate based
on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury Securities with a maturity equivalent to the warrants’ contractual life.
Property and Equipment,
Net
Property and equipment are
stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life
of five years. Significant additions and improvements are capitalized, while repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred.
Research and Development
Expenses
Research and development costs
are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs consist of scientific consulting fees, clinical trial fees and lab supplies,
as well as fees paid to other entities that conduct certain research and development activities on behalf of the Company.
The Company has acquired and
may continue to acquire the rights to develop and commercialize new product candidates from third parties. The upfront payments to acquire
license, products or rights, as well as any future milestone payments, are immediately recognized as research and development expense
provided that there is no alternative future use of the rights in other research and development projects.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company recognizes stock-based
compensation expense for stock options on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period and account for forfeitures as they
occur. The Company’s stock-based compensation costs are based upon the grant date fair value of options estimated using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model. To the extent any stock option grants are made subject to the achievement of a performance-based milestone, management
evaluates when the achievement of any such performance-based milestone is probable based on the relative satisfaction of the performance
conditions as of the reporting date.

The Company recognizes stock-based compensation
expense for restricted stock units on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period and account for forfeitures as they occur.
The Company’s stock-based compensation for restricted stocks is based upon the estimated fair value of the Common Stock.
The Black-Scholes option pricing
model utilizes inputs which are highly subjective assumptions and generally require significant judgment. Certain of such assumptions
involve inherent uncertainties and the application of significant judgment. As a result, if factors or expected outcomes change and the
Company uses significantly different assumptions or estimates, the Company’s stock-based compensation could be materially different.
Warrants
The Company accounts for stock
warrants as either equity instruments, derivative liabilities, or liabilities in accordance with FASB ASC 480,
Distinguishing
Liabilities from Equity
and FASB ASC 815,
Derivatives and Hedging,
depending on the specific terms of the warrant
agreement.
Loss per Common Share
The Company utilizes FASB
ASC 260,
Earnings per Share
. Basic loss per share is computed by dividing loss available to common stockholders by the weighted-average
number of common shares outstanding. Diluted loss per share is computed similar to basic loss per share except that the denominator is
increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued
and if the additional common shares were dilutive. Diluted loss per common share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if convertible
preferred stock, options and warrants were to be exercised or converted or otherwise resulted in the issuance of Common Stock that then
shared in the earnings of the entity.
Since the effects of outstanding stock options, restricted stock units
and warrants are anti-dilutive in the periods presented, shares of Common Stock underlying these instruments have been excluded from the
computation of loss per common share.
The following sets forth the number of shares of Common Stock underlying
outstanding stock options, restricted stock units and warrants that have been excluded from the computation of loss per common share:

2016 Stock Incentive
Plan
On April 30, 2016, the Company’s
stockholders approved the Company’s 2016 Stock Incentive Plan (the “Plan”). The Plan provides for the issuance of a
maximum of
12,500,000
shares of Common Stock to be offered to the Company’s directors, officers, employees, and consultants. On March 1, 2019,
the Company’s stockholders approved an additional
7,500,000
shares to be available for issuance under the Plan. Options granted under the Plan have an exercise price equal to or greater
than the fair value of the underlying Common Stock at the date of grant and become exercisable based on a vesting schedule determined
at the date of grant. The options expire between five  and
10
years from the date of grant. Restricted stock awards granted under the Plan are subject to a vesting period determined at the
date of grant.
2021 Stock Incentive
Plan
In February 2021, the Company’s
board of directors (the “Board”) adopted, and the stockholders approved, the Alzamend Neuro, Inc. 2021 Stock Incentive Plan
(the “2021 Plan”). The 2021 Plan authorizes the grant to eligible individuals of (1) stock options (incentive and non-statutory),
(2) restricted stock, (3) stock appreciation rights, or SARs, (4) restricted stock units, and (5) other stock-based compensation.
Stock Subject to the 2021
Plan.
The maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued under the 2021 Plan is 10,000,000 shares, which number
will be increased to the extent that compensation granted under the 2021 Plan is forfeited, expires or is settled for cash (except as
otherwise provided in the 2021 Plan). Substitute awards (awards made or shares issued by the Company in assumption of, or in substitution
or exchange for, awards previously granted, or the right or obligation to make future awards, in each case by a company that the Company
acquires or any subsidiary of the Company or with which the Company or any subsidiary combines) will not reduce the shares authorized
for grant under the 2021 Plan, nor will shares subject to a substitute award be added to the shares available for issuance or transfer
under the 2021 Plan.
All options that the Company
grants are granted at the per share fair value on the grant date. Vesting of options differs based on the terms of each option. The Company
has valued the options at their date of grant utilizing the Black-Scholes option pricing model. As of the date of issuance of these options,
there was not an active public market for the Company’s shares. Accordingly, the fair value of the underlying options was determined
based on the historical volatility data of similar companies, considering the industry, products and market capitalization of such other
entities. The risk-free interest rate used in the calculations is based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury issues with an
equivalent term approximating the expected life of the options as calculated using the simplified method. The expected life of the options
used was based on the contractual life of the option granted. Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense because the Company settles
these obligations by issuing shares of Common Stock from its authorized shares instead of settling such obligations with cash payments.

Performance Contingent
Stock Options Granted to Employee
On November 26, 2019, the
Board granted
4,250,000
performance- and market-contingent awards to certain key employees and a director. These grants were made outside
of the Plan. These awards have an exercise price of $1.50 per share. These awards have multiple separate market triggers for vesting based
upon either (i) the successful achievement of tiered target closing prices on a national securities exchange for 90 consecutive trading
days later than 180 days after the Company’s initial public offering (“IPO”) for its Common Stock, or (ii) tiered target
prices for a change in control transaction. The target prices ranged from $10 per share to $40 per share.
In the event any of the stock
price milestones are not achieved within three years
, the unvested portion of the performance options will be reduced by 25%.
On November 22, 2022, the Compensation Committee of the Board modified
the performance criteria for these awards. The target price range is now $10 per share to $20 per share. Additionally, if the stock price
milestones are now not achieved by November 27, 2026, as opposed to within three years, the unvested portion of the performance options
will be reduced by 25%. Due to the significant risks and uncertainties associated with achieving the market-contingent awards, as of July
31, 2023, the Company believes that the achievement of the requisite performance conditions is not probable and, as a result, no compensation
cost has been recognized for these awards.
On November 29, 2022, the Compensation Committee of the Board granted
2,000,000 performance-based stock option to the Chief Executive Officer at an exercise price of $1.17 per share, of which 50% vest upon
the completion and announcement of topline data from the Company’s Phase II clinical trial of AL001 within three years from grant
date and the remaining 50% vest upon the completion and announcement of topline data from the Company’s Phase I/IIA clinical trial
of ALZN002 within four years from the grant date. As of July 31, 2023, the Company believes that it is probable that the performance condition
of the completion and announcement of topline data from the Company’s Phase II clinical trial of AL001 will be achieved and had
recognized the related stock-based compensation during the three months ended January 31, 2023. As of July 31, 2023, the Company believes
that the achievement of the second performance condition is not probable and, as a result, no compensation cost has been recognized related
to Phase I/IIA of ALZN002.
Performance Contingent
Stock Options Granted to TAMM Net
On March 23, 2021, the Company issued performance-based stock options
to certain team members at TAMM Net, Inc. (“TAMM Net”) to purchase an aggregate of 450,000 shares of Common Stock at a per
share exercise price of $1.50 per share, of which 50% vest upon the completion of Phase I of AL001 by March 31, 2022, and the remaining
50% vest upon completion of Phase I/IIA of ALZN002 by December 31, 2022.
On January 19, 2023, the Board modified the performance criteria for
these awards. The remaining 50% of the grant will now vest upon the completion and announcement of topline data of the first cohort from
a Phase I/IIA clinical trial of ALZN002 on/or before March 31, 2024. Due to the significant risks and uncertainties associated with achieving
the completion of Phase I/IIA for ALZN002, as of July 31, 2023, the Company believes that the achievement of the requisite performance
conditions is not probable and, as a result, no compensation cost has been recognized for these awards related to ALZN002.

Performance Contingent
Stock Options Granted to Consultants
On October 14, 2021, the Company
issued performance-based stock options to two consultants to purchase an aggregate of
200,000
shares of Common Stock with an exercise
price of $2.42 per share, of which 50,000 vest upon completion of each of the Phase II clinical trials of AL001 for a BD indication, AL001
for a PTSD indication, AL001 for a depression indication and ALZN002 for an Alzheimer’s indication.
On January 19, 2023, the Board
modified the performance criteria for these awards. The revised grant will vest 25% if the Company (a) completes and announces topline
data from a Phase II clinical trial of AL001 and ALZN002, as applicable, that would support a new drug application for the drug candidate
and the indication listed below, and (b) obtained a “Study May Proceed” letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(“FDA”) for the additional Investigational New Drug (“IND”) on/or before December 31, 2023, as follows: (i) AL001
– bipolar disorder; (ii) AL001- major depressive disorder; (iii) AL001 – post-traumatic stress disorder; and (iv) ALZN002
– Alzheimer’s disease.
As of July 31, 2023, the Company
believes that the achievement of the requisite performance conditions is not probable and, as a result, no compensation cost has been
recognized for these awards related to Phase II of AL001 and ALZN002.

On May 1, 2016,
the Company entered into a Standard Exclusive License Agreement with Sublicensing Terms for ALZN002 with the Licensor (the “ALZN002
License”), pursuant to which the Licensor granted the Company a royalty bearing exclusive worldwide license limited to the field
of Alzheimer’s Immunotherapy and Diagnostics, under United States Patent No. 8,188,046, entitled “Amyloid Beta Peptides and
Methods of Use”, filed April 7, 2009 and granted May 29, 2012. On August 18, 2017, the Company entered into the First Amendment
to the ALZN002 License, on May 7, 2018, the Company entered into the Second Amendment to the ALZN002 License, on January 31, 2019, the

the ALZN002 License, on March 30, 2021, the Company entered into the Fifth Amendment to the ALZN002 License and on April 17, 2023, the
Company entered into the Sixth Amendment to the ALZN002 License (collectively, the “ALZN002 License Agreement”). The Sixth
Amendments to the ALZN002 License modified the timing of the payments license fees.
The ALZN002 License Agreement requires the Company to pay royalty payments
of 4% on net sales of products developed from the licensed technology for ALZN002. The Company has already paid an initial
license fee of $200,000 for ALZN002. As an additional licensing fee for the license of ALZN002, the Licensor received 3,601,809 shares
of the Company’s common stock. Minimum royalties for ALZN002 are $20,000 on the first anniversary of the first commercial sale,
$40,000 on the second anniversary of the first commercial sale and $50,000 on the third anniversary of the first commercial
sale and every year thereafter, for the life of the ALZN002 License Agreement.
On November 19,
2019, the Company entered into two Standard Exclusive License Agreements with Sublicensing Terms for two additional indications of AL001
with the Licensor (the “November AL001 License”), pursuant to which the Licensor granted the Company a royalty bearing exclusive
worldwide licenses limited to the fields of (i) neurodegenerative diseases excluding Alzheimer’s and (ii) psychiatric diseases and
disorders. On March 30, 2021, the Company entered into the First Amendments to the November AL001 License and on April 17, 2023, the Company
entered into the Second Amendments to the November AL001 License (collectively, the “November AL001 License Agreements”).
The Second Amendments to the November AL001 License modified the timing of the payments license fees.
The November AL001 License Agreements require the Company to pay royalty
payments of 3% on net sales of products developed from the licensed technology for AL001 in those fields. The Company paid
an initial license fee of $20,000 for the additional indications. Minimum royalties for November AL001 License Agreements are $40,000 on
the first anniversary of the first commercial sale, $80,000 on the second anniversary of the first commercial sale and $100,000 on
the third anniversary of the first commercial sale and every year thereafter, for the life of the November AL001 License Agreements.
These
license agreements have an indefinite term that continue until the later of the date no licensed patent under the applicable agreement
remains a pending application or enforceable patent, the end date of any period of market exclusivity granted by a governmental regulatory
body, or the date on which the Company’s obligations to pay royalties expire under the applicable license agreement. Under the various
license agreements, if the Company fails to meet a milestone by its specified date, Licensor may terminate the license agreement. The
Licensor was also granted a preemptive right to acquire such shares or other equity securities that may be issued from time to time by
the Company while the Licensor remains the owner of any equity securities of the Company.
Additionally,
the Company is required to pay milestone payments on the due dates to the Licensor for the license of the AL001 technologies and for the
ALZN002 technology, as follows:

Overview
We were
incorporated on February 26, 2016, as Alzamend Neuro, Inc. under the laws of the State of Delaware. We were formed to acquire and commercialize
patented intellectual property and know-how to prevent, treat and potentially cure the crippling and deadly Alzheimer’s. With our
two product candidates, we aim to bring treatment or cures not only for Alzheimer’s, but also, bipolar disorder (“BD”),
major depressive disorder (“MDD”) and post-traumatic stress disorder (“PTSD”). Existing Alzheimer’s treatments
only temporarily relieve symptoms but do not, to our knowledge, slow or halt the underlying worsening of the disease. We have developed
a novel approach to combat Alzheimer’s through immunotherapy.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Research and Development Expenses
.
Research
and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs consist of scientific consulting fees and lab supplies,
as well as fees paid to other entities that conduct certain research and development activities on behalf of our company.
We have acquired and may continue to acquire the
rights to develop and commercialize new product candidates from third parties. The upfront payments to acquire license, product or rights,
as well as any future milestone payments, are immediately recognized as research and development expense provided that there is no alternative
future use of the rights in other research and development projects.
Stock-Based Compensation.
We
maintain a stock-based compensation plan as a long-term incentive for employees, non-employee directors and consultants. The plan allows
for the issuance of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, restricted stock units, and other forms of equity awards.
We recognize stock-based compensation expense
for stock options on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period and account for forfeitures as they occur. Our stock-based
compensation costs are based upon the grant date fair value of options estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. To the
extent any stock option grants are made subject to the achievement of a performance-based milestone, management evaluates when the achievement
of any such performance-based milestone is probable based on the relative satisfaction of the performance conditions as of the reporting
date.
###table###
<table><tr><td> </td><td>17</td><td> </td></tr></table>

###endtable###
The Black-Scholes option pricing model utilizes
inputs which are highly subjective assumptions and generally require significant judgment. These assumptions include:
###table###
<table><tr>
<td/><td>·</td><td>Fair Value of Common Stock. See
the subsection titled “Common Stock Valuations” below.</td></tr></table>
###endtable###
###table###
<table><tr>
<td/><td>·</td><td>Risk-Free Interest Rate. The
risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero coupon issues in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with
the expected term of the option.</td></tr></table>
###endtable###
###table###
<table><tr>
<td/><td>·</td><td>Expected Volatility. Because
we do not have a sufficient trading history for our common stock (“Common Stock”), the expected volatility was estimated based
on the average volatility for comparable publicly traded life sciences companies over a period equal to the expected term of the stock
option grants. The comparable companies were chosen based on the similar size, stage in life cycle or area of specialty. We will continue
to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock price becomes available.</td></tr></table>
###endtable###
###table###
<table><tr>
<td/><td>·</td><td>Expected Term. The expected
term represents the period that the stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding and is determined using the simplified method (based
on the mid-point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term), as we do not have sufficient historical data to use any
other method to estimate expected term.</td></tr></table>
###endtable###
###table###
<table><tr>
<td/><td>·</td><td>Expected Dividend Yield. We
have never paid dividends on our Common Stock and have no plans to pay dividends on our Common Stock. Therefore, we used an expected dividend
yield of zero.</td></tr></table>
###endtable###
Certain of such assumptions involve inherent
uncertainties and the application of significant judgment. As a result, if factors or expected outcomes change and we use significantly
different assumptions or estimates, our stock-based compensation could be materially different.
Common Stock Valuations.
Prior
to our initial public offering (“IPO”) in June 2021, there was no public market for our Common Stock, and, as a result, the
fair value of the shares of Common Stock underlying our stock-based awards was estimated on each grant date by our Board. To determine
the fair value of our Common Stock underlying option grants, our Board considered, among other things, input from management, and our
Board’s assessment of additional objective and subjective factors that it believed were relevant, and factors that may have changed
from the date of the most recent valuation through the date of the grant. These factors included, but were not limited to:

Plan of Operations
We intend to develop
and commercialize therapeutics that are better than existing treatments and have the potential to significantly improve the lives of individuals
afflicted by Alzheimer’s, BD, MDD and PTSD. To achieve these goals, we are pursuing the following key business strategies:
###table###
<table><tr>
<td/><td>·</td><td>Advance clinical development of AL001 for Alzheimer’s,
BD, MDD and PTSD treatment;</td></tr></table>

to efficiently develop product candidates; and</td></tr></table>
###endtable###
###table###
<table><tr>
<td/><td>·</td><td>Optimize the value of AL001 and ALZN002 in major
markets.</td></tr></table>
###endtable###
Our
pipeline consists of two novel therapeutic drug candidates:
###table###
<table><tr>
<td/><td>·</td><td>AL001 - A patented ionic cocrystal technology
delivering a therapeutic combination of lithium, salicylate and proline through three royalty-bearing exclusive worldwide licenses from
the University of South Florida Research Foundation, Inc., as licensor (the “Licensor”); and</td></tr></table>
###endtable###
###table###
<table><tr>
<td/><td>·</td><td>ALZN002 - A patented method using a mutant peptide
sensitized cell as a cell-based therapeutic vaccine that seeks to restore the ability of a patient’s immunological system to combat
Alzheimer’s through a royalty-bearing exclusive worldwide license from the Licensor.</td></tr></table>
###endtable###
Our most advanced product
candidate (lead product) licensed and in clinical development in humans is AL001, an ionic cocrystal of lithium for the treatment of Alzheimer’s,
BD, MDD and PTSD. Based on our preclinical data involving mice models, AL001 treatment prevented cognitive deficits, depression and irritability
and is superior in improving associative learning and memory and irritability compared with lithium carbonate treatments, supporting the
potential of this lithium formulation for the treatment of Alzheimer’s, BD, MDD and PTSD in humans. Lithium has been marketed for
more than 35 years and human toxicology regarding lithium use has been well characterized, potentially mitigating the regulatory burden
for safety data.
On May 5, 2022, we initiated a multiple-dose,
steady-state, double-blind, ascending dose safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic clinical trial of AL001 in patients with mild to moderate
Alzheimer’s and healthy subjects. We completed the Phase IIA clinical trial patient dosing in March 2023 and announced positive
topline data in June 2023.
We announced that we
successfully identified a maximum tolerated dose (“MTD”) for development of AL001 from a multiple-ascending dose study as
assessed by an independent safety review committee. This dose, providing lithium at a lithium carbonate equivalent dose of 240 mg 3-times
daily (“TID”), is designed to be unlikely to require lithium therapeutic drug monitoring (“TDM”). Also, this MTD
is risk mitigated for the purpose of treating fragile populations, such as Alzheimer’s patients.
Lithium is a commonly prescribed drug for manic
episodes in BD type 1 as well as maintenance therapy of BD in patients with a history of manic episodes. Lithium is also prescribed off-label
for MDD, BD and treatment of PTSD, among other disorders. Lithium was the first mood stabilizer approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(“FDA”) and is still a first-line treatment option (considered the “gold standard”) but is underutilized perhaps
because of the need for TDM. Lithium was the first drug that required TDM by regulatory authorities in product labelling because the effective
and safe range of therapeutic drug blood concentrations is narrow and well defined for treatment of BD when using lithium salts. Excursions
above this range can be toxic, and below can impair effectiveness.
###table###
<table><tr><td> </td><td>19</td><td> </td></tr></table>
###endtable###
###table###
<table><tr><td> </td></tr></table>
###endtable###
Based on the results
from our Phase IIA MAD study, we plan to initiate two safety and efficacy clinical trials in subjects with mild to moderate dementia of
the Alzheimer’s type. Additionally, we intend to investigate the potential of AL001 for patients suffering from BD, MDD and PTSD
by submitting Investigational New Drug (“IND”) applications to the FDA for these indications. The IND for BD was filed in
August 2023 and the INDs for MDD and PTSD are expected to be filed by the end of 2023. After FDA permission to proceed on the INDs, we
intend to initiate clinical trials at this MTD to determine relative increased lithium levels in the brain compared to a marketed lithium
salt for BD, MDD and PTSD, based on published mouse studies that predict that lithium can be given at lower doses for equivalent therapeutic
benefit when treating with AL001. For example, the goal is to replace a 300 mg TID lithium carbonate dose for treatment of BD with a 240
mg TID AL001 lithium equivalent, which represents a daily decrease of 20% of lithium given to a patient.
We submitted a pre-IND
meeting request for ALZN002 and supporting briefing documents to the Center for Biological Evaluation and Research of the FDA on July
30, 2021. We received a written response relating to the pre-IND from the FDA providing a path for Alzamend’s planned clinical development
of ALZN002 on September 30, 2021. The FDA agreed to allow Alzamend to submit an IND to conduct a combined Phase I/II study.
On September 28, 2022,
we submitted an IND application to the FDA for ALZN002 and received a “study may proceed” letter on October 31, 2022. The
product candidate is an immunotherapy vaccine designed to treat mild to moderate dementia of the Alzheimer’s type. ALZN002 is a
proprietary “active” immunotherapy product, which means it is produced by each patient’s immune system. It consists
of autologous DCs that are activated white blood cells taken from each individual patient so that they can be engineered outside of the
body to attack Alzheimer’s-related amyloid-beta proteins. These DCs are pulsed with a novel amyloid-beta peptide (E22W) designed
to bolster the ability of the patient’s immune system to combat Alzheimer’s; the goal being to foster tolerance to treatment
for safety purposes while stimulating the immune system to reduce the brain’s beta-amyloid protein burden, resulting in reduced
Alzheimer’s signs and symptoms. Compared to passive immunization treatment approaches that use foreign blood products (such as monoclonal
antibodies), active immunization with ALZN002 is anticipated to offer a more robust and long-lasting effect on the clearance of amyloid.
This could provide a safer approach due to its reliance on autologous immune components, using each individual patient’s own white
blood cells rather than foreign cells and/or blood products.
On April 3, 2023, we
announced the initiation of a Phase I/IIA clinical trial for ALZN002 to treat mild to moderate dementia of the Alzheimer’s type.
The purpose of this trial is to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of multiple ascending doses of ALZN002 compared with that
of placebo in 20-30 subjects with mild to moderate morbidity. The primary goal of this clinical trial is to determine an appropriate dose
of ALZN002 for treatment of patients with Alzheimer’s in a larger Phase IIB efficacy and safety clinical trial, which Alzamend expects
to initiate within three months of receiving data from the initial trial.
The continuation of our current plan of operations
with respect to completing our IND applications and conducting the series of human clinical trials for each of our therapeutics requires
us to raise additional capital to fund our operations.
Because our working capital requirements depend
upon numerous factors, including the progress of our preclinical and clinical testing, timing and cost of obtaining regulatory approvals,
changes in levels of resources that we devote to the development of manufacturing and marketing capabilities, competitive and technological
advances, status of competitors, and our ability to establish collaborative arrangements with other organizations, we will require additional
financing to fund future operations.

Revenue
We currently
have only two product candidates, AL001 and ALZN002. These products are in the clinical stage of development and will require extensive
clinical study, review and evaluation, regulatory review and approval, significant marketing efforts and substantial investment before
either or both of them, and any respective successors, will provide us with any revenue.
We did not generate any revenues during
the three months ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, and we do not anticipate that we will generate revenue for the foreseeable future.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses for the three months ended July 31,
2023 and 2022 were $2.4 million and $1.4 million, respectively. As reflected in the table below, research and development expenses primarily

Professional Fees
During the three months ended July 31, 2023 and
2022, we reported professional fees of $1.1 million and $1.2 million, respectively, which were principally comprised of professional fees
attributed to various types of scientific services, including FDA consulting services. The decrease relates to lower professional fees
incurred related to Phase IIA clinical trial monitoring AL001 partially offset by increased professional fees related to IND preparation
for the additional indications for AL001.
Clinical Trial Fees
During the three months ended July 31, 2023 and
2022, we incurred clinical trial fees of $1.2 million and $24,000, respectively. Clinical trial fees for the three months ended July 31,
2023, consisted of $926,000 for our Phase IIA clinical trial for AL001 and $319,000 for our Phase IIA clinical trial for ALZN002. Clinical
trial fees for the three months ended July 31, 2022 were for our Phase I clinical trial for AL001.
Licenses and Fees
There are certain initial license fees and milestone
payments required to be paid to the University of South Florida and the Licensor, for the licenses of the technologies, pursuant to the
terms of the License Agreement with Sublicensing Terms.
Other Research and Development Expenses
During the three months ended July 31, 2023 and
2022, we incurred other fees of $51,000 and $156,000, respectively, which were principally comprised of scientific materials required
for our clinical trials.

Stock-Based Compensation Expense
During the three months ended July 31, 2023 and
2022, we incurred general and administrative stock-based compensation expense of $369,000 and $867,000, respectively, related to stock
option grants to executives, employees and consultants. All option grants are granted at the per share fair value on the grant date. Vesting
of options differs based on the terms of each option. We valued the options at their date of grant utilizing the Black-Scholes option
pricing model. We valued the shares issued for services at their intrinsic value on the date of issuance. Stock-based compensation is
a non-cash expense because we settle these obligations by issuing shares of our common stock from authorized shares instead of settling
such obligations with cash payments.
Professional Fees
During the three months ended July 31,
2023 and 2022, we reported professional fees of $151,000 and $243,000, respectively, which were principally comprised of the following
items:

Insurance Expense
During the three months ended July 31, 2023 and

Salaries and Benefits
During the three months ended July 31, 2023 and
2022, we incurred $153,000 and $224,000, respectively, in employee-related expenses. As of July 31, 2023, we had four full-time and three
part-time employees.
Marketing Fees
During the three months ended July 31,

Liquidity and Capital Resources
The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. We have incurred recurring net losses and operations have not provided sufficient
cash flows. We believe that we will continue to incur operating and net losses each quarter until at least the time we are able to generate
revenues from operations.
We believe our current cash on hand is insufficient to fund our planned
operations through one year after the date the financial statements are issued. These factors create substantial doubt about our ability
to continue as a going concern for at least one year after the date that our financial statements are issued.
Our inability to continue as a going
concern could have a negative impact on our company, including our ability to obtain needed financing.
We intend to finance our future development activities and our working capital needs largely through the sale of equity securities with
some additional funding from other sources, including debt financing, until such time as funds provided by operations are sufficient to
fund working capital requirements. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification
of recorded assets, or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going
concern. As of July 31, 2023, we had cash of $1.7 million, an accumulated deficit of $47.6 million and stockholders’ deficit of
$113,000. We have incurred recurring losses and reported losses for the three months ended July 31, 2023 totaling $3.5 million. In the
past, we have financed our operations principally through sales of equity securities and debt instruments.
We will need to obtain substantial additional
funding in the future for our clinical development activities and continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed
or on favorable terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce, or eliminate our research and development programs or future commercialization
efforts. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:

A change in the outcome of any of these or other
variables with respect to the development of any of our product candidates could significantly change the costs and timing associated
with the development of that product candidate. Furthermore, our operating plans may change in the future, and we may need additional
funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements associated with such operating plans.
On September 8, 2023, we
entered into a Sales Agreement with Ascendiant Capital Markets, LLC, as sales agent to sell Shares from time to time, through an ATM Offering
as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act. On September 8, 2023, we filed a prospectus supplement with the SEC relating to the offer
and sale of up to approximately $9.8 million in shares of common stock in the ATM Offering.
The offer and sale of the
Shares will be made pursuant to our effective “shelf” registration statement on Form S-3 and an accompanying base prospectus
contained therein (Registration Statement No. 333-273610) filed with the SEC on August 2, 2023 and declared effective by the SEC
on August 10, 2023.

Operating Activities
During the three months ended July 31, 2023, net
cash used in operating activities was $3.3 million. This consisted primarily of a net loss of $3.5 million and a decrease in our net operating
assets and liabilities of $152,000, partially offset by non-cash charges of $382,000. The non-cash charges primarily consisted of stock-based
compensation expense. The decrease in our net operating assets and liabilities was due to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities,
an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a decrease in prepaid expenses - related party.
Investing Activities
During the three months ended July 31, 2023, net
cash used in investing activities was $147,000 from the purchase of machinery and equipment. We purchased equipment, which draws blood
from patients and separates the monocytes from their blood, to be used in the ALZN002 clinical trials.
Financing Activities
There were no financing activities for the three months ended July
31, 2023 or 2022.
Contractual Obligations
On July 2, 2018, we entered into two Standard
Exclusive License Agreements with Sublicensing Terms for AL001 with the Licensor and its affiliate, the University of South Florida (the
“AL001 Licenses”), pursuant to which the Licensor granted us a royalty bearing exclusive worldwide licenses limited to the
field of Alzheimer’s, under United States Patent Nos. (i) 9,840,521, entitled “Organic Anion Lithium Ionic Cocrystal Compounds
and Compositions”, filed September 24, 2015 and granted December 12, 2017, and (ii) 9,603,869, entitled “Lithium Co-Crystals
for Treatment of Neuropsychiatric Disorders”, filed May 21, 2016 and granted March 28, 2017. On February 1, 2019, we entered into
the First Amendments to the AL001 Licenses, on March 30, 2021, we entered into the Second Amendments to the AL001 Licenses and on June
8, 2023, we entered into the Third Amendments to the AL001 Licenses (collectively, the “AL001 License Agreements”). The Third
Amendments to the AL001 Licenses modified the timing of the payments license fees.
The AL001 License Agreements require that
we pay combined royalty payments of 4.5% on net sales of products developed from the licensed technology for AL001. We have already paid
an initial license fee of $200,000 for AL001. As an additional licensing fee for the license of the AL001 technologies, the Licensor received
2,227,923 shares of our common stock. Minimum royalties for AL001 License Agreements are $40,000 on the first anniversary of the first
commercial sale, $80,000 on the second anniversary of the first commercial sale and $100,000 on the third anniversary of the first commercial
sale and every year thereafter, for the life of the AL001 License Agreements.
On May 1, 2016, we entered into a Standard
Exclusive License Agreement with Sublicensing Terms for ALZN002 with the Licensor (the “ALZN002 License”), pursuant to which
the Licensor granted us a royalty bearing exclusive worldwide license limited to the field of Alzheimer’s Immunotherapy and Diagnostics,
under United States Patent No. 8,188,046, entitled “Amyloid Beta Peptides and Methods of Use”, filed April 7, 2009 and granted
May 29, 2012. On August 18, 2017, we entered into the First Amendment to the ALZN002 License, on May 7, 2018, we entered into the Second
Amendment to the ALZN002 License, on January 31, 2019, we entered into the Third Amendment to the ALZN002 License, on January 24, 2020,
we entered into the Fourth Amendment to the ALZN002 License, on March 30, 2021, we entered into the Fifth Amendment to the ALZN002 License
and on April 17, 2023, we entered into the Sixth Amendment to the ALZN002 License (collectively, the “ALZN002 License Agreement”).
The Sixth Amendments to the ALZN002 License modified the timing of the payments license fees.
The ALZN002 License Agreement requires us
to pay royalty payments of 4% on net sales of products developed from the licensed technology for ALZN002. We have already paid an initial
license fee of $200,000 for ALZN002. As an additional licensing fee for the license of ALZN002, the Licensor received 3,601,809 shares
of our common stock. Minimum royalties for ALZN002 are $20,000 on the first anniversary of the first commercial sale, $40,000 on the second
anniversary of the first commercial sale and $50,000 on the third anniversary of the first commercial sale and every year thereafter,
for the life of the ALZN002 License Agreement.
On November 19, 2019, we entered into two
Standard Exclusive License Agreements with Sublicensing Terms for two additional indications of AL001 with the Licensor (the “November
AL001 License”), pursuant to which the Licensor granted us a royalty bearing exclusive worldwide licenses limited to the fields
of (i) neurodegenerative diseases excluding Alzheimer’s and (ii) psychiatric diseases and disorders. On March 30, 2021, we entered
into the First Amendments to the November AL001 License and on April 17, 2023, we entered into the Second Amendments to the November AL001
License (collectively, the “November AL001 License Agreements”). The Second Amendments to the November AL001 License modified
the timing of the payments license fees.
###table###
<table><tr><td> </td><td>24</td><td> </td></tr></table>

<table><tr><td> </td></tr></table>
###endtable###
The November AL001 License Agreements require
us to pay royalty payments of 3% on net sales of products developed from the licensed technology for AL001 in those fields. We paid an
initial license fee of $20,000 for the additional indications. Minimum royalties for November AL001 License Agreements are $40,000 on
the first anniversary of the first commercial sale, $80,000 on the second anniversary of the first commercial sale and $100,000 on the
third anniversary of the first commercial sale and every year thereafter, for the life of the November AL001 License Agreements.
These license agreements have an indefinite term
that continue until the later of the date no licensed patent under the applicable agreement remains a pending application or enforceable
patent, the end date of any period of market exclusivity granted by a governmental regulatory body, or the date on which the licensee’s
obligations to pay royalties expire under the applicable license agreement. Under our various license agreements, if we fail to meet a
milestone by its specified date, Licensor may terminate the license agreement. The Licensor was also granted a preemptive right to acquire
such shares or other equity securities that may be issued from time to time by us while the Licensor remains the owner of any equity securities
of our company.
Additionally, we are required to pay milestone
payments on the due dates to the Licensor for the license of the AL001 technologies and for the ALZN002 technology, as follows:

Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures
We have established disclosure
controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated
to management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.
Our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, with the assistance of other members of the Company’s management, have evaluated the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under
the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. Based upon our evaluation, each of our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer has concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was not effective
as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q because the Company has not yet completed its remediation of
the material weakness previously identified and disclosed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 30,
2023, the end of its most recent fiscal year.
Specifically, management
has
identified the following material weaknesses:
###table###
<table><tr>
<td/><td>1.</td><td>we do not have sufficient resources in our accounting function, which
restricts our ability to perform sufficient reviews and approval of manual journal entries posted to the general ledger and to consistently
execute review procedures over general ledger account reconciliations, financial statement preparation and accounting for non-routine
transactions; and</td></tr></table>
###endtable###
###table###
<table><tr>
<td/><td>2.</td><td>our primary user access controls (i.e., provisioning, de-provisioning,
privileged access and user access reviews) to ensure appropriate authorization and segregation of duties that would adequately restrict
user and privileged access to the financially relevant systems and data to appropriate personnel were not designed and/or implemented
effectively. We did not design and/or implement sufficient controls for program change management to certain financially relevant systems
affecting our processes.</td></tr></table>
###endtable###
A material weakness is
a control deficiency or combination of control deficiencies that result in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement
of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected.
Planned Remediation
We are implementing measures
designed to improve our internal control over financial reporting to remediate material weaknesses, including the following:
###table###
<table><tr>
<td/><td>·</td><td>Formalizing our internal control documentation
and strengthening supervisory reviews by our management; and</td></tr></table>
###endtable###
###table###
<table><tr>
<td/><td>·</td><td>Adding additional accounting personnel and segregating
duties amongst accounting personnel.</td></tr></table>
###endtable###
Management continues
to work to improve its controls related to our material weaknesses, specifically relating to user access and change management surrounding
our information technology systems and applications. Management will continue to implement measures to remediate material weaknesses,
such that these controls are designed, implemented, and operating effectively. The remediation actions include: (i) enhancing design and
documentation related to both user access and change management processes and control activities; and (ii) developing and communicating
additional policies and procedures to govern the area of information technology change management. In order to achieve the timely implementation
of the above, management has commenced the following actions and will continue to assess additional opportunities for remediation on an
ongoing basis:
###table###
<table><tr>
<td/><td>·</td><td>Engaging a third-party specialist to assist management
with improving the Company’s overall control environment, focusing on change management and access controls; and</td></tr></table>
###endtable###
###table###
<table><tr>
<td/><td>·</td><td>Implementing new applications and systems that
are aligned with management’s focus on creating strong internal controls.</td></tr></table>
###endtable###
We are currently working
to improve and simplify our internal processes and implement enhanced controls, as discussed above, to address the material weaknesses
in our internal control over financial reporting and to remedy the ineffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. These material
weaknesses will not be considered to be remediated until the applicable remediated controls are operating for a sufficient period of time
and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively.
###table###
<table><tr><td> </td><td>26</td><td> </td></tr></table>
###endtable###
###table###
<table><tr><td> </td></tr></table>
###endtable###
Despite the existence
of these material weaknesses, we believe that the condensed financial statements included in the period covered by this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented
in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Changes in Internal Control
Except as detailed above, during the quarter ended
July 31, 2023, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or is reasonably likely
to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

###endtable###
From time to time, we may be subject to legal
proceedings. We are not currently a party to or aware of any proceedings that we believe will have, individually or in the aggregate,
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an
adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors.

The risks described in Part I, Item 1A,
“Risk Factors,” in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition
and results of operations, and the trading price of our Common Stock could decline. These risk factors do not identify all risks that
we face - our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial
to our operations. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future
performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. The Risk Factors section of our 2023 Annual
Report on Form 10-K remains current in all material respects.
